As a developer you want to showcase your project portfolio and publish your
software documentation with ease. You know from experience that code examples
greatly help to get your users up to speed.

Hinode is built with the frameworks and tools you're familiar with, such as
npm, GitHub, and Bootstrap. Predefined components let you add code examples and
commands on the fly. That is why developers choose Hinode for their site.
