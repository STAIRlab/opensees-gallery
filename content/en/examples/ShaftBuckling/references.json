    "abstract": "A new 3-node co-rotational element formulation for 3D beam is presented. The present formulation differs from existing co-rotational formulations as follows: 1) vectorial rotational variables are used to replace traditional angular rotational variables, thus all nodal variables are additive in incremental solution procedure; 2) the Hellinger-Reissner functional is introduced to eliminate membrane and shear locking phenomena, with assumed membrane strains and shear strains employed to replace part of conforming strains; 3) all nodal variables are commutative in differentiating Hellinger-Reissner functional with respect to these variables, resulting in a symmetric element tangent stiffness matrix; 4) the total values of nodal variables are used to update the element tangent stiffness matrix, making it advantageous in solving dynamic problems. Several examples of elastic beams with large displacements and large rotations are analysed to verify the computational efficiency and reliability of the present beam element formulation.",

    "abstract": "In mathematics, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) converts a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function into a same-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which is a complex-valued function of frequency. The interval at which the DTFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence. An inverse DFT is a Fourier series, using the DTFT samples as coefficients of complex sinusoids at the corresponding DTFT frequencies. It has the same sample-values as the original input sequence. The DFT is therefore said to be a frequency domain representation of the original input sequence. If the original sequence spans all the non-zero values of a function, its DTFT is continuous (and periodic), and the DFT provides discrete samples of one cycle. If the original sequence is one cycle of a periodic function, the DFT provides all the non-zero values of one DTFT cycle. The DFT is the most important discrete transform, used to perform Fourier analysis in many practical applications. In digital signal processing, the function is any quantity or signal that varies over time, such as the pressure of a sound wave, a radio signal, or daily temperature readings, sampled over a finite time interval (often defined by a window function). In image processing, the samples can be the values of pixels along a row or column of a raster image. The DFT is also used to efficiently solve partial differential equations, and to perform other operations such as convolutions or multiplying large integers. Since it deals with a finite amount of data, it can be implemented in computers by numerical algorithms or even dedicated hardware. These implementations usually employ efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms; so much so that the terms \"FFT\" and \"DFT\" are often used interchangeably. Prior to its current usage, the \"FFT\" initialism may have also been used for the ambiguous term \"finite Fourier transform\".",

    "abstract": "In numerical analysis, finite-difference methods (FDM) are a class of numerical techniques for solving differential equations by approximating derivatives with finite differences. Both the spatial domain and time interval (if applicable) are discretized, or broken into a finite number of steps, and the value of the solution at these discrete points is approximated by solving algebraic equations containing finite differences and values from nearby points. Finite difference methods convert ordinary differential equations (ODE) or partial differential equations (PDE), which may be nonlinear, into a system of linear equations that can be solved by matrix algebra techniques. Modern computers can perform these linear algebra computations efficiently which, along with their relative ease of implementation, has led to the widespread use of FDM in modern numerical analysis. Today, FDM are one of the most common approaches to the numerical solution of PDE, along with finite element methods.",

The word “simple” means that complex FEM problems can be coded very easily and rapidly. SfePy can use many terms to build the PDEs to be solved, see Term Overview. SfePy comes also with a number of examples that can get you started, check Examples and Tutorial. Some more advanced features are discussed in Primer. SfePy can be used in parallel (work in progress), see Solving Problems in Parallel. There is also a preliminary support for the isogeometric analysis, outlined in Isogeometric Analysis. The easiest way to install SfePy is to use Anaconda, see Notes on Multi-platform Python Distributions in Installation.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel numerical model based on the use of coupling finite elements to simulate the behavior of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) with a discrete and explicit representation of steel fibers. The material is described as a composite made up by three phases: concrete, discrete discontinuous fibers and fiber-matrix interface. The steel fibers are modeled using two-node finite elements (truss elements) with a one-dimensional elastoplastic constitutive model. They are positioned using an isotropic uniform random distribution, considering the wall effect of the mold. A non-rigid coupling procedure is proposed for modeling the complex nonlinear behavior of the fiber-matrix interface by adopting an appropriate constitutive damage model to describe the relation between the shear stress (adherence stress) and the relative sliding between the matrix and each fiber individually. An isotropic damage model including two independent scalar damage variables for describing the concrete behavior under tension and compression is considered. To increase the computability and robustness of the continuum damage models used to simulate matrix and interface behavior, an implicit-explicit integration scheme is used. Numerical examples involving a single fiber and a cloud of fibers are performed. Comparisons with experimental results demonstrate that the application of the numerical strategy for modeling the behavior of SFRC is highly promising and may constitute an important tool for better understanding the effects of the different aspects involved in the failure process of this material.",

    "abstract": "TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.",

    "abstract": "Object-oriented approaches have emerged as one of the most promising paradigms for developing software. The approach has gained popularity in a number of fields in computer science, such as programming languages, data bases, artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, office automation, and computeraided design (CAD). Recently, object-oriented approaches have been applied to develop integrated computer-aided civil engineering systems. This paper describes our experience developing software using an object-oriented approach to integrate finite element and graphics application programs, which are to become parts of an integrated civil engineering system. The short-term objective of the project is to develop a general-purpose data-translation facility for finite element and graphicsbased programs. The long-term objective of the project is to investigate the effectiveness and viability of object-oriented approaches to integrate programs from various activities in engineering of a constructed facility. Our experiences have resulted in several practical ideas and revealed some points that are difficult to comprehend without actually going through the entire software development process.",

    "abstract": "Bonded post-tensioning tendons are used extensively in segmental bridge construction and have generally provided satisfactory service with respect to durability. However, multiple tendon failures in U.S. bridges with grouted tendons have led to the exploration of other forms of corrosion protection. One potential option is to use flexible fillers inside the tendon duct instead of cement grout that do not bond the prestressing strands to the concrete section. The use of these unbonded tendons not only affects the ultimate strength, fatigue, and serviceability behavior of structural systems, but also encourages efficient monitoring methods and facilitates tendon replacement during the structure’s service life. The current bridge design code, however, does not explicitly address flexible fillers, and little guidance is given regarding unbonded tendons in general. To evaluate the structural performance of unbonded tendons, full-scale experiments were conducted with both external and internal I-girder specimens having deviated tendon profile. These investigations provide important information on structural behavior of unbonded systems as well as tendon constructability, and can assist in the preparation of material and construction specifications. Multiple laboratory experiments were conducted with commercially available flexible fillers to examine the constructability of unbonded tendons. These experiments focused on tendon and duct detailing, filler material preparation, injection process and equipment, and venting procedures. An analytical investigation was also performed to compute the rate of cooling of flexible fillers during injection, which is a critical parameter to ensure that flow clogging does not occur. In addition, a promising tendon monitoring algorithm has been developed that uses the strain variations in the wedge plates caused by load relief due to corrosion-induced wire breaks. Extensive analytical and experimental investigations demonstrate the method’s feasibility in detecting, locating, and quantifying tendon damage.",

    "abstract": "The re-centering phenomenon of superelastic Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) reinforced concrete is a unique characteristic that is appealing for structural applications, along with the ability to respond with stable hystereses and achieve similar strength and ductility to concrete reinforced with conventional deformed bars. The objective of this study was to investigate the structural performance of superelastic SMA reinforced concrete and to develop a preliminary constitutive model applicable to nonlinear finite element algorithms. Seven simply supported flexure-critical concrete beams, reinforced with either SMA bars in the critical region or conventional deformed reinforcement, were subjected to monotonic, cyclic, and reverse cyclic loading. The experiment results demonstrated the superior capacity of the SMA beams to recover inelastic displacements. The SMA beams sustained displacement ductility and strength capacity comparable to the conventional beams. Crack widths and crack spacing were larger in the SMA beams; however, upon removal of load, the crack openings were recovered. Energy dissipation was lower in the SMA beams, particularly when subjected to reverse cyclic loading. The constitutive model based on a trilinear backbone envelope response and linear unloading and reloading rules provided satisfactory simulations.",

    "abstract": "In many extended versions of the finite element method (FEM) the mesh does not conform to the physical domain. Therefore, discontinuity of variables is expected when some elements are cut by the boundary. Thus, the integrands are not continuous over the whole integration domain. Apparently, none of the well developed integration schemes such as Gauss quadrature can be used readily. This paper investigates several modifications of the Gauss quadrature to capture the discontinuity within an element and to perform a more precise integration. The extended method used here is the finite cell method (FCM), an extension of a high-order approximation space with the aim of simple meshing. Several examples are included to evaluate different modifications.",

    "abstract": "In this work we propose a numerical solution procedure for nonlinear instability problems for geometrically exact beams (representing arbitrary large displacements and rotations) under either conservative or nonconservative load. Both static and dynamics frameworks are developed, with the latter needed for nonconservative case. The proposed model can also successfully deliver the analytic solution to linearized insta­ bility problems (with small pre-buckling displacements) for critical loads of Euler (no shear) and Timoshenko (with shear) cantilever beam, which is used for validation for both conservative and non-conservative loads. We also validated the proposed geometrically exact beam models against the analytic solutions to nonlinear problem (with finite rotations) and pointed out their advantage in providing a more sound interpretation of instability for both conservative and non-conservative loads. Finally, the proposed models performance is illustrated on more complex problems with corresponding numerical solutions obtained by using both the geometrically exact finite elements for Reissner beam (with shear) and for the Kirchhoff beam (no shear).",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a robust hybrid genetic algorithm for optimization of space structures using the augmented Lagrangian method. An attractive characteristic of genetic algorithm is that there is no line search and the problem of computation of derivatives of the objective function and constraints is avoided. This feature of genetic algorithms is maintained in the hybrid genetic algorithm presented in this paper. Compared with the penalty function-based genetic algorithm, only a few additional simple function evaluations are needed in the new algorithm. Furthermore, the trial and error approach for the starting penalty function coefficient and the process of arbitrary adjustments are avoided. There is no need to perform extensive numerical experiments to find a suitable value for the penalty function coefficient for each type or class of optimization problem. The algorithm is general and can be applied to a broad class of optimization problems.",

    "abstract": "In the building industry, building data such as objects and processes are described in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model schema to support a neutral data exchange format for BIM tools interoperability. While IFC specification has been encoded in ifcXML format by buildingSMART to support XML-based data transmission, there is a lack of studies on the implementation of IFC specification using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) serialization. JSON is a key-value style lightweight data exchange format that has higher parsing efficiency than XML and due to the inadequacies of XML, JSON has been widely used in Web applications, specifically in Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) Web services. This paper highlights the need for JSON implementation of IFC specification and introduces ifcJSON Schema and its data content. The main objective of this study is to outline how IFC specification can be represented in JSON format. Therefore, the study explains the implementation of the IFC standard as a JSON schema to guide the creation of JSON documents. The ifcJSON documents can be used for web-based data transfer as an alternative to XML documents. Since current IFC specification release is IFC4 Add1, the implementation of ifcJSON4 schema is specified and guidelines for generating and validating ifcJSON documents are described. Additionally, this paper implements ifcJSON4 schema in a use case within the precast concrete domain by indicating the data content for a precast building element with its corresponding geometry representation, product placement, and owner history data. The analysis of results indicates that ifcJSON4 schema developed in this paper is a valid JSON schema that can guide the creation of valid ifcJSON documents to be used for web-based data transfer and to improve interoperability of Cloud-based BIM applications.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic neural networks are becoming increasingly common, and yet it is hard to implement them efficiently. On-the-fly operation batching for such models is sub-optimal and suffers from run time overheads, while writing manually batched versions can be hard and error-prone. To address this, we extend TensorFlow with pfor, a parallel-for loop optimized using static loop vectorization. With pfor, users can express computation using nested loops and conditional constructs, but get performance resembling that of a manually batched version. Benchmarks demonstrate speedups of one to two orders of magnitude on a range of tasks, from Jacobian computation, to auto-batching Graph Neural Networks.",

    "abstract": "TensorFlow Eager is a multi-stage, Python-embedded domain-specific language for hardware-accelerated machine learning, suitable for both interactive research and production. TensorFlow, which TensorFlow Eager extends, requires users to represent computations as dataflow graphs; this permits compiler optimizations and simplifies deployment but hinders rapid prototyping and run-time dynamism. TensorFlow Eager eliminates these usability costs without sacrificing the benefits furnished by graphs: It provides an imperative front-end to TensorFlow that executes operations immediately and a JIT tracer that translates Python functions composed of TensorFlow operations into executable dataflow graphs. TensorFlow Eager thus offers a multi-stage programming model that makes it easy to interpolate between imperative and staged execution in a single package.",

    "abstract": "Response sensitivity computations for nonlinear geometry are required in structural reliability, optimization, and system identification. Compared to finite difference and complex perturbation methods, the direct differentiation method (DDM) of the governing response equations offers an approach to response sensitivity computations that is both accurate and efficient. Several formulations of DDM response sensitivity have been developed for material nonlinear planar and space frame finite elements; however, the DDM has only been applied to geometrically nonlinear frame elements in two dimensions. The corotational formulation of large displacements is versatile for three dimensional simulations of frame structures because it separates geometric and material nonlinearity at the element level. However, the main difficulty of the corotational formulation for space frame elements is that finite rotations are not true vector quantities and the structural response depends on the order in which rotations are applied. Through analytic differentiation of an approximate algorithm to apply rotations, the response sensitivity equations are obtained for the corotational formulation of space frame elements and are implemented in the OpenSees finite element framework. To verify the accuracy of the derived sensitivity equations, standalone sensitivity analysis compares the proposed DDM with the finite difference method (FDM) for a space frame structure.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient response gradients are required in structural reliability, optimization, and system identification applications where the structural system is expected to yield under significant deformations. The direct differentiation method (DDM) is applied to the response sensitivity of displacementbased beam-column finite elements with geometric nonlinearity due to moderate rotations in the basic system. The derived sensitivity equations are implemented in the OpenSees software framework. Standalone sensitivity analyses using the DDM and finite difference method (FDM) validate the sensitivity equations for example structures with nonlinear static and dynamic response. Finite element reliability analysis of a steel frame shows that, relative to a geometrically linear formulation, using geometrically nonlinear displacement-based elements increases the probability of failure and affects the importance ranking of the random variables. In addition, for a performance function based on residual capacity at a target lateral displacement, the frame strength at the design point is higher than that obtained when using geometrically linear elements. The developed sensitivity equations increase the number of nonlinear finite element formulations available for gradient-based applications in structural engineering.",

    "abstract": "We explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to model spatial processes in which there is no a priori graphical structure. Similar to finite element analysis, we assign nodes of a GNN to spatial locations and use a computational process defined on the graph to model the relationship between an initial function defined over a space and a resulting function in the same space. We use GNNs as a computational substrate, and show that the locations of the nodes in space as well as their connectivity can be optimized to focus on the most complex parts of the space. Moreover, this representational strategy allows the learned inputoutput relationship to generalize over the size of the underlying space and run the same model at different levels of precision, trading computation for accuracy. We demonstrate this method on a traditional PDE problem, a physical prediction problem from robotics, and learning to predict scene images from novel viewpoints.",

    "abstract": "The ÿnite element analysis of delamination in laminated composites is addressed using interface elements and an interface damage law. The principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics are indirectly used by equating, in the case of single-mode delamination, the area underneath the traction=relative displacement curve to the critical energy release rate of the mode under examination. For mixed-mode delamination an interaction model is used which can fulÿl various fracture criteria proposed in the literature. It is then shown that the model can be recast in the framework of a more general damage mechanics theory. Numerical results are presented for the analyses of a double cantilever beam specimen and for a problem involving multiple delamination for which comparisons are made with experimental results. Issues related with the numerical solution of the non-linear problem of the delamination are discussed, such as the in uence of the interface strength on the convergence properties and the ÿnal results, the optimal choice of the iterative matrix in the predictor and the number of integration points in the interface elements.

IDARC-2D is a widely used and accepted software for nonlinear analysis; it possesses many attractive features and capabilities. However, it is operated from the command prompt in the DOS/Unix systems and requires elaborate text-based input files creation by the user. To complement and facilitate the use of IDARC-2D, a pre-processing GUI software package (INSPECT) is introduced herein. INSPECT is created in the C# environment and utilizes the .NET libraries and SQLite database. Extensive testing and verification demonstrated successful and high-fidelity re-creation of several existing IDARC-2D input files. Its design and built-in features aim at expediting, simplifying and assisting in the modeling process. Moreover, this practical aid enhances the reliability of the results and improves accuracy by reducing and/or eliminating many potential and common input mistakes. Such benefits would be appreciated by novice and veteran IDARC-2D users alike.",

Features of UFL include support for variational forms and functionals, automatic differentiation of forms and expressions, arbitrary function space hierarchies for multi-field problems, general differential operators and flexible tensor algebra. With these features, UFL has been used to effortlessly express finite element methods for complex systems of partial differential equations in near-mathematical notation, resulting in compact, intuitive and readable programs. We present in this work the language and its construction. An implementation of UFL is freely available as an open-source software library. The library generates abstract syntax tree representations of variational problems, which are used by other software libraries to generate concrete low-level implementations. Some application examples are presented and libraries that support UFL are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a procedure for response prediction in high-rise buildings under wind loads. The procedure is illustrated in an application example of a tall building exposed to both cross-wind and along-wind loads. The responses of the building in the lateral directions combined with torsion are estimated simultaneously. Results show good agreement with recent design standards; however, the proposed procedure has the advantages of accounting for complex mode shapes, non-uniform mass distribution, and interference effects from the surrounding. In addition, the technique allows for the contribution of higher modes. For accurate estimation of the acceleration response, it is important to consider not only the first two lateral vibrational modes, but also higher modes. Ignoring the contribution of higher modes may lead to underestimation of the acceleration response; on the other hand, it could result in overestimation of the displacement response. Furthermore, the procedure presented in this study can help decision makers, involved in a tall building design/retrofit to choose among innovative solutions like aerodynamic mitigation, structural member size adjustment, damping enhancement, and/or materials change, with an objective to improve the resiliency and the serviceability under extreme wind actions.",

    "abstract": "A nonlinear beam finite-element model is developed to account for distributed plasticity, complex degradation phenomena, axial–moment–shear interactions, and geometric nonlinearity. The formulation is derived based on consistently coupled degradation-plasticity multiaxial hysteretic laws. The strength degradations corresponding to axial, shear, and flexural capacities are treated as scalar damage functions, and the multiaxial hysteretic model is presented in the effective stress domain to satisfy the consistency criterion of the evolving yield/capacity surface. Geometric nonlinearity is incorporated through an element-level P-Δ formulation, by accounting for second-order transverse displacement effects in the beam kinematics. Constant element matrices, including elastic stiffness, geometric stiffness, and hysteretic matrices, are derived from the principle of virtual work and do not require updating throughout the analysis. Material inelasticity and degradations evolve through element-level ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on the multiaxial hysteretic laws and are solved simultaneously with the governing equations of motion of the system. Overall, the entire system-level formulation is presented in state-space form and can be straightforwardly solved using any general first-order ODE solver without requiring gradient evaluations. Model consistency, validity, and versatility are demonstrated through several numerical illustrations and experimental verifications.

The fundamental topics of kinematics in finite and infinitesimal deformation, mechanical and thermodynamic balances plus entropy imbalance in the small strain setting are covered as they apply to all solids. The major material models of Elasticity, Viscoelasticity, and Plasticity are detailed and models for Fracture and Fatigue are discussed. In addition to these topics in Solid Mechanics, because of the growing need for engineering students to have a knowledge of the coupled multi-physics response of materials in modern technologies related to the environment and energy, the book also includes chapters on Thermoelasticity, Chemoelasticity, Poroelasticity, and Piezoelectricity. A preview to the theory of finite elasticity and elastomeric materials is also given. Throughout, example computations are presented to highlight how the developed theories may be applied.",

The phenomenology of the elastic-plastic response of isotropic polycrystalline materials in a tension test is discussed. The additive decomposition of the strain into an elastic part and a plastic part is introduced, along with the concept of an equivalent tensile plastic strain. The notion of a yield condition and a plastic flow rule, together with the concept of isotropic strain-hardening are discussed, and complete models for both rate-independent and rate-dependent elastoplasticity are formulated. In addition, basic numerical methods for evaluating both rate-independent and rate-dependent plasticity models are presented.",

    "abstract": "The problem of assessing the structure state following potential damage occurrence by exploiting vibration signal measurements produced by earthquake excitation is addressed. A damage assessment algorithm for structures under earthquake excitation is introduced. This method is based on a residual associated with output-only subspace-based modal identification and global χ 2 -tests built on that residual. This method makes effective use of the non-stationary and limited duration earthquake excitation, handles its stochastic uncertainties, and further assesses the structural damage. Since records have limited size, a new computation scheme, based on the stochastic bootstrap, is used to compute the residual covariance. An instrumented bridge, the Painter Street Overpass in California that has experienced more than ten earthquakes of different intensities was selected as a case study. Numerical results obtained from these experimental data are reported, using both identification and detection methods.",

    "abstract": "Operating systems and applications in the built environment have relied upon central authorization and management mechanisms which restrict their scalability, especially with respect to administrative overhead. We propose a new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation.",

These geometrically and mechanically exact nonlinear theories can be used to describe physically important effects not accounted for by their classical predecessors. This paper begins with a sketch of early theories of the mechanics of rods and shells. It then gives a critical account of the pioneering and immediately influential 1958 paper Ericksen wrote with C. Truesdell. It next describes Ericksen’s subsequent contributions to the formulation and analysis of specific problems for these Cosserat theories, and how they resolved some open issues. This paper concludes with a discussion of refinements of these theories and a commentary on their modern roles.",

    "abstract": "We continue our fundamental discourse on the natural modes in an element and extend our considerations to large displacements. First, we present a general procedure for establishing the so-called geometrical stiffness k G , when the natural modes of the complete element are given. The theory is a substantial generalisation and clarification of the method initially given in refs. 2 and 3 and shows that in establishing the modification to the transformation matrix a N it is necessary to ignore the contribution of the natural modes, which cause rotation at the nodal points but no displacement there. The point is subtle and was not made in ref. 2, although the applications given there are correct. As an example, the geometrical stiffness of a straight beam in space with all degrees of freedom is established. There follows the extension of the geometrical stiffness concept to a sub-element. This is of great practical significance for two reasons. First, it allows to derive the geometrical stiffness of elements of complex shape and behaviour, e.g. curved beams in space subjected to normal forces, bending moments and torque.",

    "abstract": "Geometrical stiffness is the basis for any attempt to study the behaviour of slender beams and thin shells under conditions in which large deflections may occur with small strains. Not all problems require high accuracy in the representation of the geometrical stiffness, Theseare generally certain self-equilibrating stress systems (natural modes) which are the principal contributors to the geometrical stiffness. In particular, stress systems which produce rigid body moments due to rigid body rotations of the element are generally most important. Also, very great differences in bending stiffness about different axes may make it necessary to consider otherwise unimportant natural forces.",

    "abstract": "Several recorded motions for seven bridge systems in California during recent earthquakes were analysed using parametric and non-parametric system identification (SI) methods. The bridges were selected considering the availability of an adequate array of accelerometers and accounting for different structural systems, materials, geometry and soil types. The results of the application of SI methods included identification of modal frequencies and damping ratios. Excellent fits of the recorded motion in the time domain were obtained using parametric methods. The multi-input/single-output SI method was a suitable approach considering the instrumentation layout for these bridges. Use of the constructed linear filters for prediction purposes was also demonstrated for three bridge systems. Reasonable prediction results were obtained considering the various limitations of the procedure. Finally, the study was concluded by identifying the change of the modal frequencies and damping of a particular bridge system in time using recursive filters.

    "abstract": "Modal parameters of structural systems have commonly been determined using system identiÿcation (SI) methods for damage detection and health monitoring. For determining the deterioration of the integrity of structural systems correctly, modal parameters of a healthy structure have to be obtained with adequate certainty so that these parameters can be used as reliable references for the healthy system to compare with those of the damaged system. In this study, the statistical signiÿcance of modal parameters identiÿed using strong motion time histories recorded on two bridge structures is assessed. The conÿdence intervals of identiÿed modal frequencies and damping ratios are obtained using Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses in conjunction with eigenrealization algorithm. The dependence of the statistical bounds on model parameters is examined. The e ect of using di erent number of sensors on the statistical signiÿcance is evaluated using simulated time history data from a validated ÿnite element model of a bridge.

    "abstract": "We present in this paper a discussion of the properties of dierent mixed and enhanced ®nite element formulations in the ®nite deformation range based on closed-form expressions of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a rectangular element under an axial stress in plane strain. These analyses allow to identify the locking properties of the ®nite elements in dierent situations (namely, incompressible and shear locking), as well the appearance of numerical instabilities. In particular, we identify the presence of material instabilities, that is, negative stiness in the constant strain response of the material (and so exact and independent of the particular ®nite element under consideration) as the cause for the appearance of numerical instabilities in the form of hourglassing. This is particularly the case in the original enhanced elements in plane strain problems. This situation is to be contrasted with the standard mixed Q1/P0 element, which is shown to avoid these numerical instabilities in the plane strain case through an alternative regularization of the volumetric stiness contributions to the hourglass modes. This observation allows for the identi®cation of a new assumed/enhanced formulation that avoids the observed numerical instabilities in the plane strain, without resorting to stabilization techniques relying on user-de®ned parameters. The new formulation simply involves the constant scaling of the original enhanced deformation gradient with only two enhanced modes, maintaining the full locking-free response of the element and the important strain driven structure of the ®nite element formulation. Full details of the numerical implementation of these ideas are presented, as well as several numerical simulations illustrating the performance of the new formulation. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

    "abstract": "We present in this paper a discussion of the properties of dierent mixed and enhanced ®nite element formulations in the ®nite deformation range based on closed-form expressions of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a rectangular element under an axial stress in plane strain. These analyses allow to identify the locking properties of the ®nite elements in dierent situations (namely, incompressible and shear locking), as well the appearance of numerical instabilities. In particular, we identify the presence of material instabilities, that is, negative stiness in the constant strain response of the material (and so exact and independent of the particular ®nite element under consideration) as the cause for the appearance of numerical instabilities in the form of hourglassing. This is particularly the case in the original enhanced elements in plane strain problems. This situation is to be contrasted with the standard mixed Q1/P0 element, which is shown to avoid these numerical instabilities in the plane strain case through an alternative regularization of the volumetric stiness contributions to the hourglass modes. This observation allows for the identi®cation of a new assumed/enhanced formulation that avoids the observed numerical instabilities in the plane strain, without resorting to stabilization techniques relying on user-de®ned parameters. The new formulation simply involves the constant scaling of the original enhanced deformation gradient with only two enhanced modes, maintaining the full locking-free response of the element and the important strain driven structure of the ®nite element formulation. Full details of the numerical implementation of these ideas are presented, as well as several numerical simulations illustrating the performance of the new formulation. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new class of assumed strain finite elements to use in combination with general energymomentum-conserving time-stepping algorithms so that these conservation properties in time are preserved by the fully discretized system in space and time. The case of interest corresponds to nearly incompressible material responses, in the fully non-linear finite strain elastic and elastoplastic ranges. The new elements consider the classical scaling of the deformation gradient with an assumed Jacobian (its determinant) defined locally through a weighted averaging procedure at the element level. The key aspect of the newly proposed formulation is the definition of the associated linearized strain operator or B-bar operator. The developments presented here start by identifying the conditions that this discrete operator must satisfy for the fully discrete system in time and space to inherit exactly the conservation laws of linear and angular momenta, and the conservation/dissipation law of energy for elastic and inelastic problems, respectively. Care is also taken of the preservation of the relative equilibria and the corresponding group motions associated with the momentum conservation laws, and characterized by purely rotational and translational motions superimposed to the equilibrium deformed configuration. With these developments at hand, a new general B-bar operator is introduced that satisfies these conditions. The new operator not only accounts for the spatial interpolations (e.g. bilinear displacements with piece-wise constant volume) but also depends on the discrete structure of the equations in time. The aforementioned conservation/dissipation properties of energy and momenta are then proven to hold rigorously for the final numerical schemes, unconditionally of the time step size and the material model (elastic or elastoplastic). Different finite elements are considered in this framework, including quadrilateral and triangular elements for plane problems and brick elements for three-dimensional problems. Several representative numerical simulations are presented involving, in particular, the use of energy-dissipating momentum-conserving time-stepping schemes recently developed by the author and co-workers for general finite strain elastoplasticity in order to illustrate the properties of the new finite elements, including these conservation/dissipation properties in time and their locking-free response in the quasi-incompressible case.

    "abstract": "The objective of this work is to develop finite elements for the simulation of thin Kirchhoff rods, that is, rods where the influence of transverse shear strain can be neglected leading to governing equations that require C1-continuous finite element interpolations. We start in this paper with the formulation of new finite elements for the infinitesimal plane deformations of otherwise generally curved rods, addressing in particular the lack of invariance observed in related traditional treatments of plane arches. By noninvariance we mean that the classical rigid-body modes of translations and infinitesimal rotations of the underlying structural theory lead to non-zero strains in the element, an effect sometimes referred to as self-straining. This phenomenon occurs in curved configurations of the elements and, in the infinitesimal setting of interest in this paper, it results in the elements stiffness matrix not to exhibit the correct zero-energy modes associated with these physical rigid-body motions. As a consequence, the basic equilibrium relations of balance of forces and moments are not satisfied for the associated nodal forces and moments in non-invariant finite elements. In this context, we propose a new framework for the formulation of C1-continuous finite elements based on Hermitian shape functions that do lead to the satisfaction of this fundamental invariance property, accounting fully for the rod’s curvature and associated Kirchhoff’s kinematics in contrast to common straight (framework) element approximations based on the simplified Euler–Bernoulli beam kinematics. The formulation relies crucially on a consistent treatment of the kinematics and the assumed interpolation of the rods geometry. An additional assumed strain treatment is considered to avoid limitations of membrane locking. Complete rigorous analyses and several numerical simulations are presented to prove and illustrate the properties and performance of the newly proposed finite element methods.",

The second formulation relaxes the constraint between warping and twisting, with the analyses presented here identifying explicitly for the first time how its enforcement can be achieved in a limit process controlled by a parameter depending on the cross-sectional geometry. Hence, it avoids the anomalies of the first formulation, but at the price to involve local stresses not in equilibrium, a situation that does not seem to be much present in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Existing formulations of warping torsion rely on a direct approximation of the warping displacement of the cross sections, even when this approach leads to several limitations. For example, assuming the warping to be directly proportional to the rate of twist results in a high-order governing equation and anomalies in which the twisting components of the stress and internal torque are distorted by the restrainment of the warping. As identified recently by the author, this situation reveals the presence of a kinematic warping–twist constraint in this particular approach, whose relaxation through an independent warping field still with a fixed distribution of the section’s warping, results in non–equilibrated stresses despite its wide use in recent computational models. As an alternative, we consider in this paper a mixed treatment of the axial strain and stress appearing when warping is restrained, extending an early idea of Reissner. In fact, the paper presents a new structural mixed formulation of restrained warping, based on a non–uniform distribution of the shape of the warping on the cross sections, also controlled by an independent warping field, but crucially involving the aforementioned mixed axial kinematics. Theoretical results presented here indicate the suitability of the new formulation, resolving the aforementioned issues of existing formulations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an evaluation of the mixed formulation of warping torsion developed in the first part of this work. Specifically, we present a comparative study with two widely-used existing formulations, namely, the TWKV formulation of Timoshenko–Wagner–Kappus–Vlasov involving only the twist rotation (thus constraining the twist to the warping) and the RBV formulation of Reissner–Benscoter–Vlasov incorporating an additional warping field, as the newly proposed mixed formulation. However, in big contrast to those two formulations, the new formulation involves an alternative kinematic relation between the twist and warping motivated by a full mixed treatment of the axial strain–stress response. The evaluations are based on the exact closed-form solution for a model problem of a prismatic elastic shaft, with the torsional constants appearing in the different formulations computed with plane finite element approximations of the relevant warping functions on the cross section. The structural models are also compared with full 3D finite element simulations of the elastic solids. The new mixed formulation is found to improve upon the over-stiff constrained TWKV formulation as well as the RBV formulation with its physically incorrect stresses.",

Moment resisting frames are widely used as lateral resisting systems when sufficient ductility is to be met. Generally three types of moment resisting frames are designed in practice namely Special, Intermediate and Ordinary Moment Frames, each of which has certain level of ductility. Comparative studies on the seismic performance of these three different types of structure are performed in this study. Analytical models of connections are employed including panel zone and beam to column joint model. Incremental dynamic analysis is then utilized to assess the structural dynamic behavior of the frames and to generate required data for performance based evaluations. Maximum annual probability of exceeding different limit states may reveal the superiority of a ductile structure in which a greater behavior factor is employed. Special moment resisting frames are expected to perform better once a certain level of ductility is to be met but the amount of superiority may be the subject of investigation especially from a performance based design standpoint.",

Test specimens were made of back-to-back A36 steel angle sections connected to the end gusset plates by fillet welds or high-strength bolts. Five of the test specimens were designed according to current design procedures and code requirements. These specimens experienced fracture in gusset plates and stitches during early cycles of loading. Based on the observations and analysis of the behavior of these specimens, new design procedures are proposed for improved ductility and energy dissipation capacity of double-angle bracing members which buckle out of plane of gusset plates. Tests of four specimens, designed using proposed procedures, showed significant improvement in their performances.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to deal with modeling uncertainty when updating mechanics-based nonlinear finite element (FE) models. In this framework, a dual adaptive filtering approach is adopted, where the Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used to estimate the unknown parameters of the nonlinear FE model and a linear Kalman filter (KF) is employed to estimate the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix of the simulation error vector based on a covariance-matching technique. Numerically simulated response data of a two-dimensional three-story three-bay steel frame structure with eight unknown material model parameters subjected to unidirectional horizontal seismic excitation is used to illustrate and validate the proposed methodology. Geometry, inertia properties, gravity loads, and damping properties are considered as sources of modeling uncertainty and different levels and combinations of them are analyzed. The results of the validation studies show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the parameter-only estimation approach widely investigated and used in the literature. Thus, a more robust and comprehensive identification of structural damage is achieved when using the proposed approach. A different input motion is then considered to verify the prediction capabilities of the proposed methodology by using the FE model updated by the parameter estimation results obtained.",

The goal herein is to understand where modeling errors and uncertainty originate from, and obtain model predictions that are statistically consistent with their respective measurements. The approach presented in this manuscript is comprehensive, as it considers all major sources of errors and uncertainty that originate from numerical solutions of differential equations (numerical uncertainty), imprecise model input parameter values (parameter uncertainty), incomplete definitions of underlying physics due to assumptions and idealizations (bias error) and variability in measurements (experimental uncertainty). The experimental evidence necessary for reducing the uncertainty in model predictions is obtained through in situ vibration measurements conducted on the masonry vaults of Washington National Cathedral. By deploying the prescribed method, uncertainty in model predictions is reduced by approximately two thirds.",

    "abstract": "In developing mechanistic models, we establish assumptions regarding aspects of the system behavior that are not fully understood. Such assumptions in turn may lead to a simplified representation or omission of some underlying phenomena. Although necessary for feasibility, such simplifications introduce systematic bias in the model predictions. Often times model bias is non-uniform across the operational domain of the system of interest. This operational domain is defined by the control parameters, i.e., those that can be controlled by experimentalists during observations of the system behavior. The conventional approach for addressing model bias involves empirically inferring a functional representation of the discrepancy with respect to control parameters and accordingly bias-correcting model predictions. This conventional process can be considered as experimental data fitting informed by theoretical knowledge, only providing a one-way interaction between simulation and observation. The model calibration approach presented herein recognizes that assumptions established during model development may require omission or simplification of interactions among model input parameters. When prediction accuracy relies on the inclusion of these interactions, it becomes necessary to infer the functional relationships between the input parameters from experiments. As such, this study demonstrates a two-way interaction in which theoretical knowledge is in turn informed by experimental data fitting. We propose to empirically learn previously unknown parameter interactions through the training of functions emulating these relationships. Such interactions can be posed in the form of reliance of model input parameter values on control parameter settings or on other input parameters. If the nature of the interactions is known, appropriate parametric functions may be implemented. Otherwise, nonparametric emulator functions can be leveraged. In our study, we use nonparametric Gaussian Process models in the Bayesian paradigm to infer the interactions among input parameters from the experimental data. The proposed approach will equip model developers with a tool capable of identifying the underlying and mechanistically-relevant physical processes absent from engineering models. This approach has the potential to not only significantly reduce the systematic bias between model predictions and experimental observations, but also further engineers’ knowledge of the physics principles governing complex systems.",

    "abstract": "An appropriate strain energy density for an isotropic hyperelastic Hookean material is proposed for finite strain from which a constitutive relationship is derived and applied to problems involving beam theory approximations. The physical Lagrangian stress normal to the surfaces of a element in the deformed state is a function of the normal component of stretch while the shear is a function of the shear component of stretch. This paper attempts to make a contribution to the controversy about who is correct, Engesser or Haringx with regard to the buckling formula for a linear elastic straight prismatic column with Timoshenko beam-type shear deformations. The derived buckling formula for a straight prismatic column including shear and axial deformations agrees with HaringxÕs formula. Elastica-type equations are also derived for a three-dimensional Timoshenko beam with warping excluded. When the formulation is applied to the problem of pure torsion of a cylinder no second-order axial shortening associated with the Wagner effect is predicted which differs from conventional beam theory. When warping is included, axial shortening is predicted but the formula differs from conventional beam theory.",

    "abstract": "Abutment behavior significantly influences the seismic response of certain bridge structures. Specifically in the case of short bridges with relatively stiff superstructures typical of highway overpasses, embankment mobilization and inelastic behavior of the soil material under high shear deformation levels dominate the response of the bridge and its column bents. This paper investigates the sensitivity of bridge seismic response with respect to three different abutment modeling approaches. The abutment modeling approaches are based on three increasing levels of complexity that attempt to capture the critical components and modes of abutment response without the need to generate continuum models of the embankment, approach, and abutment foundations. Six existing reinforced concrete bridge structures, typical of Ordinary Bridges in California, are selected for the analysis. Nonlinear models of the bridges are developed in OpenSees. Three abutment model types of increasing complexity are developed for each bridge, denoted as roller, simplified, and spring abutments. The roller model contains only single-point constraints. The spring model contains discrete representations of backfill, bearing pad, shear key, and back wall behavior. The simplified model is a compromise between the efficient roller model and the comprehensive spring model. Modal, pushover, and nonlinear dynamic time history analyses are conducted for the six bridges using the three abutment models for each bridge. Comparisons of the analysis results show major differences in mode shapes and periods, ultimate base shear strength, as well as peak displacements of the column top obtained due to dynamic excitation. The adequacy of the three abutment models used in the study to realistically represent all major resistance mechanisms and components of the abutments, including an accurate estimation of their mass, stiffness, and nonlinear hysteretic behavior, is evaluated. Recommendations for abutment modeling are made.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an inelastic beam element for the analysis of steel-concrete girders with partial composite action under monotonic and cyclic loads. The element is derived from a two-field mixed formulation with independent approximation of internal forces and transverse displacements. The nonlinear response of the steel and concrete component of the girder is based on the section discretization into fibers with uniaxial hysteretic material models for the constituent materials. The partial interaction between concrete deck and steel girder through shear connectors is accounted for by an interface model with distributed force transfer characteristics. A direct state determination algorithm for the implementation of the composite element in a general purpose nonlinear analysis program is presented, and the stability characteristics of the algorithm are discussed in conjunction with the selection of appropriate force and displacement interpolation functions. The validity of the model is established by correlation of analytical results with experimental evidence. Numerical studies are used to compare the model with the classical displacement formulation. These studies confirm the superiority of the proposed model in modeling composite girders under monotonic and cyclic loads that induce stiffness deterioration and strength softening.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a nonlinear model for pretensioned prestressed concrete girders. The model consists of three main components: a beam-column element that describes the behavior of concrete, a truss element that describes the behavior of prestressing tendons, and a bond element that describes the transfer of stresses between the prestressing tendons and the concrete. The model is based on a two-field mixed formulation, where forces and deformations are both approximated within the element. The nonlinear response of the concrete and tendon components is based on the section discretization into fibers with uniaxial hysteretic material models. The stress transfer mechanism is modeled with a distributed interface element with special bond stress-slip relation. A method for accurately simulating the prestressing operation is presented. Accordingly, a complete nonlinear analysis is performed at the different stages of prestressing. Correlation studies of the proposed model with experimental results of pretensioned specimens are conducted. These studies confirmed the accuracy and efficiency of the model.",

    "abstract": "Numerical models developed to predict the seismic response of structures deforming into the inelastic range often fail the conventional validation test: they fail to reproduce the experimentally obtained response to a particular ground motion with acceptable accuracy. This paper claims that this is too strict of a test for seismic response modelling. The Earthquake Engineering design problem involves predicting the statistics of the response to an ensemble of ground motions characterizing a given seismic hazard; not to a single ground motion. This is a weaker model validation test that requires that the structural model to only to be unbiased and to introduce less uncertainty than the uncertainty of the excitation itself. In this paper, we propose a weak form of seismic response analysis model validation. As an example, we use the 1963 Housner dynamic response model of a rocking structure. We performed 600 shaking table seismic response tests using a welldefined and repeatable rocking structure as well as 600 numerical simulations of these tests, and compared both the individual test response and the statistical aggregates of these response focused on predicting limit states such as overturning or maximum tilt angle. We show that the 1963 Housner model passes the weak validation test even though it fails the strong validation test. Therefore, the model is good enough for the scope of Earthquake Engineering. In conclusion, we propose broader application of weak validation models and outline possible acceptance criteria consistent with probabilistic seismic performance objectives for design and evaluation of structures.",

    "abstract": "Sensorized commercial buildings are a rich target for building a new class of applications that improve operational and energy efficiency of building operations that take into account human activities. Such applications, however, rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema that would enable porting these applications and systems to different buildings. Our demo presents Brick [4], a uniform schema for representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and relationships among them, which enables portable applications. Using a web application, we will demonstrate real buildings that have been mapped to the Brick schema, and show application queries that extracts relevant metadata from these buildings. The attendees would be able to create example buildings and write their own queries.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the effects upon the design point search of gradient discontinuities caused by non-smoothness of material constitutive models in the context of finite element reliability analysis. The response computation algorithm for the Menegotto-Pinto smooth material constitutive model is extended to response sensitivity analysis using the Direct Differentiation Method. Response sensitivity and reliability analysis results are compared for a structural system modelled using smooth and non-smooth material constitutive laws, respectively. Both material and discrete loading sensitivity parameters are considered. Structural reliability analyses are performed using the First-Order Reliability Method. Implications of using smooth versus nonsmooth material constitutive models in finite element response, response sensitivity and reliability analyses are discussed. A sufficient condition on the smoothness of uni-axial material constitutive models for obtaining continuous finite element response sensitivities is stated and proved for the quasi-static case. The issue of continuity/discontinuity of response sensitivities for the dynamic case is discussed within the application examples.",

    "abstract": "A key aspect of robotics today is estimating the state, such as position and orientation, of a robot as it moves through the world. Most robots and autonomous vehicles depend on noisy data from sensors such as cameras or laser rangefinders to navigate in a three-dimensional world. This book presents common sensor models and practical advice on how to carry out state estimation for rotations and other state variables. It covers both classical state estimation methods such as the Kalman filter, as well as important modern topics such as batch estimation, the Bayes filter, sigmapoint and particle filters, robust estimation for outlier rejection, and continuous-time trajectory estimation and its connection to Gaussian-process regression. The methods are demonstrated in the context of important applications such as point-cloud alignment, pose-graph relaxation, bundle adjustment, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Students and practitioners of robotics alike will find this a valuable resource.",

In this paper, it is assessed as a tool for engineering design. The paper discusses the forward and reverse modes of AD, their computing requirements, as well as approaches to implementing AD. It continues with the application of two different tools to two medium-size structural analysis problems to generate sensitivity information typically necessary in an optimization or design situation. The paper concludes with the observation that AD is to be preferred to finite differencing in most cases, as long as sufficient computer storage is available; in some instances, AD may be the alternative to consider in lieu of analytical sensitivity analysis.",

The Bosphorus Bridge is the first long-span suspension bridge in Turkey and has been carrying the majority part of Istanbul’s heavy traffic along with the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge. Due to its critical function for the city of Istanbul, reliably understanding the structural behavior of the bridge under various loading events, such as wind, earthquake and heavy traffic becomes important issue for the bridge authority of KGM and structural bridge engineers. For this objective, relatively advanced shell element type is considered in this study to develop FE model of the bridge. In order to indicate the accuracy of 3-D full-scale shell model, the dynamic characteristics from the recently-developed FE model are compared with those obtained from the previous numerical and experimental studies. A good comparison is obtained for the established FE model, and the model and its specifications are concluded to be utilized for further analyses of the bridge.",

The solution is given in terms of Jacobi’s elliptical functions and illustrated by several numerical examples and several graphical presentations of shapes of deformed cantilevers. Possible forms of the underlying elastica of a cantilever are discussed in detail, and various simple formulas are given for calculating the characteristic dimensions of the elastica. For the case when a cantilever is subject only to applied force, three load conditions are discussed: the follower load problem, the load determination problem, and the conservative load problem. For all cases, either a formula or an effective procedure for determining the solution is provided. In particular, a new efficient procedure is given to determine all possible equilibrium shapes in the case of the conservative load problem.",

    "abstract": "The present paper investigates the formulation of 3D co-rotational beam elements for the buckling and postbuckling analysis of frame structures. Following Pacoste and Eriksson [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 144 (1997) 163], the term co-rotational relates here to the provision of a local reference frame that continuously rotates and translates with the element. Within this context, several issues are emphasised. The first one refers to the parameterisation of finite 3D rotations. The alternative put forth in the paper is based on the spatial form of the incremental rotational vector. The second issue concerns warping effects which are introduced by adding a seventh degree of freedom at each node. Different types of local formulations are considered and it is shown that at least some degree of non-linearity must be introduced in the local strain definition in order to obtain correct results for certain classes of problems. Within the present approach the centroid and shear center of the cross-section are not necessarily coincident. Finally, in the context of instability problems, a method for the direct computation of critical points is also briefly discussed. This is based on a minimal augmentation procedure as developed by Eriksson [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 156 (1998) 45; Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 179 (1999) 265; Int. J. Struct. Stability Dynamic 1 (1) (2001)]. Ten examples, including large displacement and stability problems, are used in order to assess the performances of the elements. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

    "abstract": "The corotational framework for triangular shell elements has been presented by different authors (see the Introduction). The purpose of this paper is to introduce three modifications in this approach. The first one is a simplified definition of the local rotations. The second one is a reduction of the number of local degrees of freedom from 18 to 15. The third and principal one concerns the parameterisation of the global finite rotations. A new approach based on Euler parameters (quaternion) is proposed. In particular, it is shown that only three parameters are required. The purpose of these three modifications is to obtain a formulation which gives the same numerical results but which is computationally more efficient than the original one. This aspect is illustrated in several numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale engineering analylsis programs are among the most difficult to develop, maintain, and extend. The translation of a few pages of classical mathematics turns into tens of thousands of lines of nontrivial code. This paper discusses the role of data abstraction in engineering program development, where data, instead of processes, are used to decompose a program into parts. Data abstraction improves the modularity of a program by encapsulating implementation details and by providing a clear delineation between design and implementation. We describe a library of finite element data types that have been designed with data abstraction in mind. Using this approach, multiple, representations and algorithms coexist, with proper selection made at run time. In addition, space-time trade-offs can generally be postponed without impacting other parts of the program. Throughout the paper, we address design issues with careful specifications of program behavior and implementation issues using object-oriented languages, which support data abstraction as well as polymorphism and inheritance.",

    "abstract": "Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply “autodiff”, is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other’s results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names “dynamic computational graphs” and “differentiable programming”. We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms “autodiff”, “automatic differentiation”, and “symbolic differentiation” as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.",

    "abstract": "A key component to the success of deep learning is the use of gradient-based optimization. Deep learning practitioners compose a variety of modules together to build a complex computational pipeline that may depend on millions or billions of parameters. Differentiating such functions is enabled through a computational technique known as automatic differentiation. The success of deep learning has led to an abstraction known as differentiable programming, which is being promoted to a first-class citizen in many programming languages and data analysis frameworks. This often involves replacing some common non-differentiable operations (eg. binning, sorting) with relaxed, differentiable analogues. The result is a system that can be optimized from end-to-end using efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms. A differentiable analysis could be optimized in this way — basic cuts to final fits all taking into account full systematic errors and automatically analyzed. This Snowmass LOI outlines the potential advantages and challenges of adopting a differentiable programming paradigm in high-energy physics.",

    "abstract": "A substantial effort has been made in recent years to characterise the behaviour of semi-rigid connections. Recent studies and modern codes, in particular EC3 and EC4, not only include methods and formulas to define both their resistance and stiffness, but also emphasise the importance of a correct modelling of the panel zone under shear and compressive forces. The traditional approach of modelling the connection by means of springs attached to the end of the beams at both sides of the joint implies the use of an interaction parameter, called the β factor in EC3 and EC4, that depends on the moments and shear forces acting on the panel zone. Both the stiffness and strength of the springs depend on this parameter. However, the definition of the β factor implies an approximation of the internal forces at the joint, and therefore its use requires an iterative process at the time of performing the global analysis of the structure.",

    "abstract": "Connections are a key component of steel structures. Current methods of analysis of steel frames mostly rely on approximate joint models based on zero-length rotational springs or mechanical models of rigid bars and springs. A method is presented in this paper to accurately model the stiffness of 2D welded steel joints that is based on surrogate modelling. The joint modelling process starts by developing an accurate 4-node (12 degree of freedom) cruciform finite element from a complete finite element model using substructuring techniques. Then a modal decomposition of these matrices yields the eigenvalues and mode shapes that are used to develop the design points of the training and validation sets of the surrogate model. The modal decomposition leads to a reduced set of variables that accurately models the design space. A uniform Rectangular Grid of design sites is proposed. The Kriging method and Support Vector Machine Regression are used to generate the metamodels and predict the stiffness at untried sites. Both methods provide accurate results. Simulations of steel frames are performed to show the accuracy of the proposed surrogate modelling.",

This simple rule yields at most three component relations which are the generators of many known universal relations for isotropic elasticity theory, including the well-known universal rule for a simple shear. Universal relations for four families of nonhomogenevus deformations known to be controllable in every incompressible, homogeneous and isotropic elastic material are exhibited. These same universal relations may hold for special compressible materials. New universal relations for a homogeneous controllable shear, a nonhomogeneous shear, and a variable extension are derived. The general universal relation for an arbitrary isotropic tensor function of a symmetric tensor also is noted.",

    "abstract": "This paper shows how the Performance-based Design (PBD) of bridges is facilitated by taking advantage of recent developments in parallel and cloud computing. In order to have a realistic assessment of the performance of a bridge subjected to severe ground shaking, sophisticated three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic structural and geotechnical analyses need to be performed, that account not only for the structural characteristics, but also the ground conditions, the type of earthquake motions and the soil-structure-interaction. The simulation of the nonlinear dynamic response of a bridge to various levels of earthquakes is a very challenging and tedious process, which requires significant computational capabilities. A viable and cost-effective option to overcome computational limitations in high intensive PBD of bridges and soil-structure interactions, is to adopt cloud and parallel computing techniques in the analysis. Elasticity of cloud services provides engineers a platform to add and remove pay-as-you-go compute resources to meet the size and time requirements commensurate with the size and type of the bridge model being analyzed. This paper shows how the significant reduction in the time required to process a suite of ground motions for PBD, and the flexibility of cloud computing in assigning tasks to different processor, allow bridge engineers to perform various types of sophisticated nonlinear analyses in parallel. A case study to illustrate how the incremental dynamic analysis of a three-dimensional bridge with soil-structure interaction using parallel computing in clouds is presented and discussed. The efficiency and flexibility of using cloud computing for PBD of bridges is emphasized.",

    "abstract": "The problem of determining linear models of structures from seismic response data is studied using ideas from the theory of system identification. The investigation employs a general formulation called the output-error approach, in which optimal estimates of the model parameters are obtained by minimizing a selected measure-of-fit between the responses of the structure and the model. The question of whether the parameters can be determined uniquely and reliably in this way is studied for a general class of linear structural models. Because earthquake records are normally available from only a small number of locations in a structure, and because of measurement noise, it is shown that it is necessary in practice to estimate parameters of the dominant modes in the records, rather than the stiffness and damping matrices. Two output-error techniques are investigated. Tests of the first, an optimal filter method, show that its advantages are offset by weaknesses which make it unsatisfactory for application to seismic response. A new technique, called the modal minimization method, is developed to overcome these difficulties. It is a reliable and efficient method to determine the optimal estimates of modal parameters for linear structural models. The modal minimization method is applied to two multi- story buildings that experienced the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. New information is obtained concerning the properties of the higher modes of the taller building and more reliable estimates of the properties of the fundamental modes of both structures are found. The time-varying character of the equivalent linear parameters is also studied for both buildings. It is shown for the two buildings examined that the optimal, time-invariant, linear models with a small number of modes can reproduce the strong-motion records much better than had been supposed from previous work using less systematic techniques.",

Theoretical aspects are considered here, while numerical results of test problems are discussed in a companion paper. Special features possessed by structural optimization problems, together with recent developments in mathematical programming (recursive quadratic programming methods, global convergence theory), have formed a basis for conducting the study.

    "abstract": "Clustered (continuous) cables reflect an advantageous solution for reducing the number of tensile elements in engineering systems. During the tensioning or activation of tensile structures, such as cable structures, membranes and tensegrity structures, the deficiency of having to control too many elements can be overcome by employing clustered cables. The use of clustered cables has been shown to alter the structural behavior of tensile systems by modifying the force distribution in the systems. This effect has been showcased under the assumption of frictionless sliding of the cable elements across nodes or pulleys. However, friction can have also impact on the behavior of the system. In this paper, a new Finite Element formulation is proposed for the static analysis of tensile structures with clustered cables. The proposed formulation accommodates sliding-induced friction by the consideration of the Euler-Eytelwein equation as well as geometric nonlinearities. It is found that the sliding-induced friction can significantly modify the force distribution in the system. The applicability and importance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated through the analysis of two examples from the literature.",

    "abstract": "In applied optimization, an understanding of the sensitivity of the optimal value to changes in structural parameters is often essential. Applications include parametric optimization, saddle point problems, Benders decompositions, and multilevel optimization. In this paper we adapt a known automatic differentiation (AD) technique for obtaining derivatives of implicitly defined functions for application to optimal value functions. The formulation we develop is well suited to the evaluation of first and second derivatives of optimal values. The result is a method that yields large savings in time and memory. The savings are demonstrated by a Benders decomposition example using both the ADOL-C and CppAD packages. Some of the source code for these comparisons is included to aid testing with other hardware and compilers, other AD packages, as well as future versions of ADOL-C and CppAD. The source code also serves as an aid in the implementation of the method for actual applications. In addition, it demonstrates how multiple C++ operator overloading AD packages can be used with the same source code. This provides motivation for the coding numerical routines where the floating point type is a C++ template parameter.",

In contrast to many previously proposed beam finite element formulations the present discretization approach retains the frame‐indifference (or objectivity) of the underlying beam theory. The space interpolation of rotational degrees‐of‐freedom is circumvented by the introduction of a reparameterization of the weak form corresponding to the equations of motion of the geometrically exact beam theory.

    "abstract": "An in-depth analysis of the deterioration mechanisms in high-strength wires of suspension bridge cables is presented. Accelerated cyclic corrosion tests were conducted to assess the relative effect of corrosion on galvanized and ungalvanized wires. Samples were corroded under various levels of sustained loads in a cabinet that cyclically applied an acidic salt spray, dry conditions, and 100% relative humidity at elevated temperature, and mass loss, hydrogen concentration, ultimate load, and elongation at failure were measured. Elongation measurements indicated a significant embrittlement of the wires that could not be explained solely by the presence of absorbed hydrogen ͑hydrogen embrittlement͒. The main cause of reduction of wire elongation was found to be the surface irregularities induced by the corrosion process. The experimental results were validated through a numerical analysis using a finite-element method model of the corroded steel wire and through a series of scanning electron microscope analyses of the fracture surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Traditional as well as performance-based seismic design requires accurate simulation of building response to determine component deformation and load demands. This is particularly challenging for reinforced concrete structures in which concrete cracking prior to yield may change component stiffnesses substantially and for existing concrete structures in which inadequate design details may result in component strength loss prior to yield. In this study analytical models, which are practical for use in design and compatible with commercial software such as SAP2000, are developed for one type of concrete component: planar interior beam-column joints. A dataset comprising 45 joint sub-assemblage tests is used for model development. First, a simple, center-line model is proposed for elastic analysis in which the beam-column joint region is modeled as semi-rigid. Experimental data are used to determine the joint stiffness that minimizes the error in predicted inter-story drift and the new ASCE 41 recommendations are evaluated. A second model is developed for use in a nonlinear pushovertype analysis. For this model, joint flexibility and beam flexural response are represented by plastic hinges at beam ends. A simple empirically-based model is used to determine, on the basis of joint shear stress demand and bond stress demand within the joint, if system response will be ductile or brittle. A joint shear strain limit determines when strength loss will occur in brittle joints. For ductile joints, the behavior of the sub-assemblage is dominated by the nonlinear response of the beams.",

    "abstract": "The proper handling of 3D orientations is a central element in many optimization problems in engineering. Unfortunately many researchers and engineers struggle with the formulation of such problems and often fall back to suboptimal solutions. The existence of many different conventions further complicates this issue, especially when interfacing multiple differing implementations. This document discusses an alternative approach which makes use of a more abstract notion of 3D orientations. The relative orientation between two coordinate systems is primarily identified by the coordinate mapping it induces. This is combined with the standard exponential map in order to introduce representation-independent and minimal differentials, which are very convenient in optimization based methods.",

    "abstract": "The proper handling of 3D orientations is a central element in many optimization problems in engineering. Unfortunately many researchers and engineers struggle with the formulation of such problems and often fall back to suboptimal solutions. The existence of many different conventions further complicates this issue, especially when interfacing multiple differing implementations. This document discusses an alternative approach which makes use of a more abstract notion of 3D orientations. The relative orientation between two coordinate systems is primarily identified by the coordinate mapping it induces. This is combined with the standard exponential map in order to introduce representation-independent and minimal differentials, which are very convenient in optimization based methods.",

    "abstract": "The Q2 – P1 approximation is one of the most popular Stokes elements. Two possible choices are given for the deÿnition of the pressure space: one can either use a global pressure approximation (that is on each quadrilateral the ÿnite element space is spanned by 1 and by the global co-ordinates x and y) or a local approach (consisting in generating the local space by means of the constants and the local curvilinear co-ordinates on each quadrilateral and Á). The former choice is known to provide optimal error estimates on general meshes. This has been shown, as it is standard, by proving a discrete inf–sup condition. In the present paper we check that the latter approach satisÿes the inf–sup condition as well. However, recent results on quadrilateral ÿnite elements bring to light a lack in the approximation properties for the space coming out from the local pressure approach. Numerical results actually show that the second choice (local or mapped pressure approximation) is suboptimally convergent. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

The fundamentals and statics of “secondary moments” in indeterminate prestressed members is discussed and explained in detail. Examples are presented for the analysis and the design of multi-span prestressed concrete beams in accordance with the new code.

    "abstract": "There is today a strong interest and general commitment toward the quality of the things that engineering is creating. Generally speaking, quality involves and concerns different aspects of the engineering products, like the aesthetics, the ergonomics, the comfort, the structural serviceability, the structural safety and the durability. From this point of view, quality means, at the end, sustainability in the most general sense. All these aspects should be considered in a modern conceptual design of a bridge structure. The structure should be defined taking into account wide criteria and the critical aspects, which give clarity and coherence to the whole structural design, must be strongly pointed out.",

    "abstract": "This article is concerned with the numerical integration of finite strain continuum damage models. The numerical sensitivity of two damage evolution laws and two numerical integration schemes are investigated. The two damage models differ in that one of the models includes a threshold such that the damage evolution is suppressed until a certain effective plastic strain is reached. The classical integration scheme based on the implicit Euler scheme is found to suffer from a severe step-length dependence. An alternative integration scheme based on a diagonal implicit Runge–Kutta scheme originally proposed by Ellsiepen (1999) is investigated. The diagonal implicit Runge–Kutta scheme is applied to the balance of momentum as well as the constitutive evolution equations. When applied to finite strain multiplicative plasticity, the diagonal implicit Runge–Kutta scheme destroys the plastic incompressibility of the underlying continuum evolution laws. Here, the evolution laws are modified such that the incompressibility of the plastic deformation is preserved approximately. The presented numerical examples reveal that a significant increase in accuracy can be obtained at virtually no cost using the diagonal implicit Runge–Kutta scheme. It is also shown that for the model including a discontinuous evolution law, the superiority of the diagonal implicit Runge–Kutta scheme over the implicit Euler scheme is reduced.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a complete formulation of the representation and parameterization of frame motion as a tool to derive, in a convenient form, the kinematic and dynamic governing equations of mechanical systems characterized by both position and orientation fields. Typical applications are rigid bodies, beams, shells, and multibody systems. The description of such systems may be performed using compact 4-D and 6-D matrix representations, leading to the extension of many of the well-known concepts and properties of rotations to the group of rigid displacements. Two parameterization procedures are fully developed in connection to the proposed representations: the exponential map of motion and Cayley’s parameterization. Both allow for a consistent, unified treatment of the coupled linear and angular components of motion. This approach entails remarkable algorithmic implications.",

In the early 1980s, Filippou et al. improved the original model by introducing isotropic hardening and highlighted a flaw in the original formulation. Specifically, these researchers observed that if partial unloading takes place at strains lower than the maximum value the reloading path provides forces that are higher than those expected. Notwithstanding, Filippou et al. deemed that these errors were not particularly significant and did not propose any modification to the formulation of the model. In the opinion of the writers, this conclusion may be questionable and thus an improved version of the Menegotto and Pinto model is proposed here. In particular, the abovementioned flaw is eliminated and the improvement of this model over the original Menegotto and Pinto model is shown.",

    "abstract": "The model proposed by Menegotto and Pinto (1973) is widely used to simulate the dynamic response of steel structures and steel bars of reinforced concrete structures. In the early 1980s, Filippou et al. (1983) improved the original model by introducing isotropic hardening and highlighted a flaw in the original formulation. Specifically, these researchers observed that if partial unloading takes place at strains lower than the maximum recorded value, the reloading path provides forces that are higher than those expected. Filippou et al. deemed that such errors were not particularly significant for reinforced concrete members and did not propose any modification to the analytical formulation of the model. In the opinion of the writers, this observation is convincing when dealing with reinforced concrete members but is questionable when referring to steel members. The abovementioned flaw is eliminated in this paper from the Menegotto and Pinto model and the improvement over the original model is shown by means of nonlinear dynamic analyses on simple reinforced concrete and steel frames.",

    "abstract": "We study the integration of problems of evolution in the rotation group. Instead of attacking the problem in the nonlinear differential manifold SO(3) (pure rotational dynamics), as is usually done, we derive equations for the complete problem of motion (translational and rotational dynamics) on an extended manifold. We develop a generalization of Runge-Kutta methods that, by design, ensures that the solution will remain on the manifold for any choice of the tableau. This is obtained through configuration updates performed via the exponential map. We show how certain terms can be approximated, while retaining the order of accuracy of the scheme, and how the method conserves the total momentum of the system. Within this framework, we develop two nonlinearly unconditionally stable time integration schemes, that are associated with discrete laws of conservation/dissipation of the total energy. The dissipating algorithm generalizes to the nonlinear case the high frequency damping characteristics provided by some well-known conventional methods. We present numerical results to support our analysis, and we develop a complete application of this methodology to the nonlinear dynamics of three-dimensional rods undergoing large displacements and finite rotations, under the assumption of small strains. 0 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

    "abstract": "A dynamic beam on a nonlinear Winkler foundation (or “‘dynamic p-y’”) analysis method for analyzing seismic soil-pile-structure interaction was evaluated against the results of a series of dynamic centrifuge model tests. The centrifuge tests included two different single-pile-supported structures subjected to nine different earthquake events with peak accelerations ranging from 0.02 to 0.7g. The soil profile consisted of soft clay overlying dense sand. Site response and dynamic p-y analyses are described. Input parameters were selected based on existing engineering practices. Reasonably good agreement was obtained between calculated and recorded responses for both structural models in all earthquake events. Sensitivity of the results to dynamic p-y model parameters and site response calculations are evaluated. These results provide experimental support for the use of dynamic p-y analysis methods in seismic soil-pile-structure interaction problems.",

    "abstract": "As computation has advanced, more designers are becoming familiar with parametric and performance-based design space exploration, techniques that can provide feedback and guidance even in early-stage design. However, two downsides of such techniques are the time and expertise required for problem setup, and the potential for the large volume of generated data to become overwhelming and difficult to absorb. Researchers must find ways to organize performance-based information and simplify exploration so that the design process is more manageable, while ensuring that performance feedback leads to better outcomes. This paper proposes two new applications of traditional optimization methods that can help simplify early-stage architectural or structural parametric design. The first involves analyzing the design variables considered in the problem, ranking their importance, and determining which ones should be eliminated or emphasized during exploration. The second method clusters designs into families and enables designers to cycle through these families during exploration. Two structural design case studies are presented to illustrate the possibilities created by variable analysis and clustering in conceptual, performance-based design.",

In many applications, systematic variation may cause the best values for the calibration parameters to change across different settings. When not accounted for in the code, this variation can make the computer model inadequate. We propose a framework for modeling the calibration parameters as functions of the control inputs to account for a computer model’s incomplete system representation in this regard, while simultaneously allowing for possible constraints imposed by prior expert opinion. We demonstrate how inappropriate modeling assumptions can mislead a researcher into thinking a calibrated model is in need of an empirical discrepancy term when it is only needed to allow for a functional dependence of the calibration parameters on the inputs. We apply our approach to plastic deformation of a visco-plastic selfconsistent material in which the critical resolved shear stress is known to vary with temperature.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a sensitivity analysis for dynamic systems with large rotations using a semi-analytical direct differentiation technique. The choice of a suitable time integration strategy for the rotation group appears to be critical for the development of an efficient sensitivity analysis. Three versions of the generalized- time integration scheme are considered: a residual form, a linear form, and a geometric form. Their consistency is discussed, and we show that the residual form, which is the most direct extension of the generalized- algorithm defined in structural dynamics, should not be used for problems with large rotations. The sensitivity analysis is performed and close connections are highlighted between the structure of the sensitivity equations and of the linearized dynamic equations. Hence, algorithms developed for the original problem can be directly reused for the sensitivities. Finally, a numerical example is analysed in detail. Copyright q 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

These equations form a differential–algebraic equation (DAE) of index 2 with unilateral constraints. For the numerical solution, implicit Runge–Kutta methods are combined with the return mapping strategy of computational plasticity. It turns out that the convergence order depends crucially on the switching point detection. Furthermore, it is shown that algebraically stable Runge–Kutta methods preserve the contractivity of the elastoplastic flow.  2002 IMACS. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Some of Buckminster Fuller’s \"Tensegrity\" structures have fewer bars than are necessary to satisfy Maxwell’s rule, and yet are not \"mechanisms\" as one might expect, but are actually stiff structures. Maxwell anticipates special cases of this sort, and states that their stiffness will \"be of a low order\". In fact, the conditions under which Maxwell’s exceptional cases occur also permit at least one state of \"self-stress\" in the frame.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the analytical conditions under which a pin-jointed assembly, which has s independent states of self-stress and m independent mechanisms, tightens up when its mechanisms are excited. A matrix algorithm is set up to distinguish between first-order infinitesimal mechanisms (which are associated with second-order changes of bar length) and higher-order infinitesimal or finite mechanisms. It is shown that, in general, this analysis requires the computation of s quadratic forms in m variables, which can be easily computed from the states of self-stress and mechanisms of the assembly. If any linear combination of these quadratic forms is sign definite, then the mechanisms are first-order infinitesimal. An efficient and general algorithm to investigate these quadratic forms is given. The calculations required are illustrated for some simple examples.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a computationally efficient optimal design approach for suspension bridges. The proposed method utilizes a coupled suspension-bridge modelling approach, which integrates an analytical form-finding method with the conventional finite element (FE) model to enhance the FE modelling efficiency during the optimization process. This study also employs an enhanced particle swarm optimization (EPSO), which introduces a particle categorization mechanism to handle the constraints instead of the commonly used penalty method, to improve the computational efficiency of the optimization procedure. The numerical investigation examines the feasibility and computational efficiency of the proposed method on the optimization of a three-span suspension bridge with both size and geometric design variables. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully overcomes the difficulties in the FE-based suspension bridge optimization, while considering the bridge geometric parameters (the sagto-span ratio and side-to-central span ratio) as design variables, and improves significantly the computational efficiency of PSO-based methods as used in large-scale and complex structural optimization problems.",

    "abstract": "The formulation of time integration algorithms for mechanism analysis problems is discussed. Particular aspects to be considered are the treatment of constraints and of the finite rotation associated terms. It is shown that in order to time integrate constrained systems, the algorithmic damping at infinite frequency is of utmost importance. It is demonstrated that the Newmark trapezoidal rule is unconditionally unstable in the presence of constraints. The use of second order accurate dissipative algorithms like the Hilber-Hughes-Taylor scheme is recommended. Finally, the integration of finite rotation associated terms is performed by projecting the equations onto the tangent space to the rotation group. In this way, well-known results of accuracy and convergence can be applied. Several examples illustrating the covered topics are presented.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of the rocking and overturning response of rigid blocks to earthquakes is a complex task, due to its high sensitivity to the input motion, variations in geometry and dissipation issues. This paper presents a literature review dealing with classical and advanced approaches on rocking motion with particular reference to masonry walls characterized by a monolithic behavior. Firstly, the pioneering work of Housner based on the concept of the inverted pendulum is discussed in terms of the most significant parameters, i.e., the size and slenderness of the blocks, the coefficient of restitution and ground motion properties. Free and restrained rocking blocks are considered. Then, static force-based approaches and performance-based techniques, mostly based on limit analysis theory, are presented to highlight the importance of investigating the evolution of the rocking mechanisms by means of pushover curves characterized by negative stiffness. From a dynamic perspective, a review of probabilistic approaches is also presented, evaluating the cumulative probability of exceedance of any response level by considering different earthquake time histories. Some recent simplified approaches based on the critical rocking response and the worst-case scenario are illustrated, as well.",

    "abstract": "We provide definitions for the “material transport”, or “comateriality”, of various mathematical objects of physical interest in continuum mechanics. Use is made of the concept of Lie dragging, i.e. of “pushing forward” and “pulling back” objects along path lines. Vectors in a Euclidean space can be comaterial in only two different senses, related to the behavior of their contravariant and covariant convected components; second-order tensors, regarded as linear transformations on a Euclidean vector space, can be comaterial in four different senses, related to their contravariant, covariant, and mixed representations; and, so on for tensors of higher order. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for comateriality. These lead immediately to other conditions that can be stated in terms of “comaterial rates”, which are Lie derivatives. Extensions and generalizations of the Helmholtz-Zorawski criterion are presented. The results are kinematical in nature and hold for all materials.",

Nine years later, Pixar released Toy Story, which went on to revolutionize the industry, gross $360 million, and establish Pixar as one of the most successful, innovative, and emulated companies on earth. This book details how Catmull built an enduring creative culture – one that doesn’t just pay lip service to the importance of things like honesty, communication, and originality, but committed to them, no matter how difficult that often proved to be. As he discovered, pursuing excellence isn’t a one-off assignment. It’s an ongoing, day-in, day-out, full-time job. And one he was born to do\"–",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a formulation of the geometrically exact three-dimensional beam theory where the shape functions of three-dimensional rotations are obtained from strains by the analytical solution of kinematic equations. In general it is very demanding to obtain rotations from known rotational strains. In the paper we limit our studies to the constant strain field along the element. The relation between the total three-dimensional rotations and the rotational strains is complicated even when a constant strain field is assumed. The analytical solution for the rotation matrix is for constant rotational strains expressed by the matrix exponential. Despite the analytical relationship between rotations and rotational strains, the governing equations of the beam are in general too demanding to be solved analytically. A finite-element strain-based formulation is presented in which numerical integration in governing equations and their variations is completely omitted and replaced by analytical integrals. Some interesting connections between quantities and non-linear expressions of the beam are revealed. These relations can also serve as useful guidelines in the development of new finite elements, especially in the choice of suitable shape functions.",

The resulting expression for this new element is accurate in describing the force-versus-displacementrelations at the element level, is simple, and it does not lead to a significant numerical truncating error in the computer analysis. Its implementation in a nonlinear analysis program is straightforward. The accuracy of the analysis results by the element was found to be considerably higher than its cubic counterpart in a number of well-known examples. The limitation or inconvenience of the method of stability function such as the separation of the solution for tensile, compressive,and zero load casesis eliminated.",

    "abstract": "The versatile Bouc–Wen model has been used extensively to describe hysteretic phenomena in various fields of engineering. Nevertheless, it is known that it exhibits displacement drift, force relaxation and nonclosure of hysteretic loops when subjected to short unloading–reloading paths. Consequently, it locally violates Drucker’s or Ilyushin’s postulate of plasticity. In this study, an effective modification of the model is proposed which eliminates these problems. A stiffening factor is introduced into the hysteretic differential equation which enables the distinction between virgin loading and reloading. Appropriate reversal points are utilized effectively to guide the entire process. It is shown that the proposed modification corrects the nonphysical behavior of the model under short unloading–reloading paths without affecting its response in all other cases. It is further demonstrated that the original and modified model exhibit significantly different response under seismic excitation.",

Although, with very few exceptions, the previous models in the literature make the simplified assumption that this motion is planar, this is usually not true since a body will probably not be aligned with the direction of the ground motion. Thus, even in the case where the body is fully symmetric, the rocking motion involves three dimensional rotations and displacements.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms that may lead to failure of rocking bodies is significantly important in quantifying and minimizing the associated risk. The most common model to describe the rocking problem is the inverted pendulum model (IPM) proposed by George W. Housner, which has been followed by multiple researchers. It is often claimed that the IPM is an acceptable model if behaviors such as sliding, uplifting, deformability, and the three-dimensional nature of the response can be restrained mechanically. However, even in a suitably chosen case in which the previous may indeed have a minimal effect in the response, there are still uncertainties with regard to the assumption introduced in the IPM of how energy is lost during impacts. This paper focuses on this assumption and investigates the effects in the stability of rocking bodies. The effect of this assumption is discussed, showing that the associated uncertainty points to whether a rocking body would survive or fail when subjected to a ground excitation. A method that quantifies this uncertainty by making use of a dynamic property of the rocking system is introduced.

    "abstract": "Identification of system parameters from seismic accelerations recorded on a base-isolated bridge provides an excellent opportunity to examine the performance of various components of such bridge systems. This study proposes a two-step system identification method for identifying structural parameters from strong motion records. The first step entails identification of complex modal parameters of a nonclassically damped base-isolated bridge-pier-pile-foundation system for which necessary theoretical formulations are first derived. In the second step a global search scheme is introduced to identify the structural parameters of the system corresponding to the identified modal parameters. The proposed system identification method is applied to two base-isolated bridges such that recorded responses at pier cap and girder are successfully recreated for one main shock and four aftershocks of the 1995 Kobe earthquake and modal and structural parameters are identified. Performance of the base-isolation system is evaluated by comparing the physical properties of the bearings, determined from experimental data, with the identified values and is found to be satisfactory in both bridges.",

    "abstract": "The probability of union events is always important in management science. Many real life applications use such probability in their core implementations. The most popular method to calculate the probability of union events is the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (IEP), which originates from the idea of Abraham de Moivre (1718). However, the computation complexity is exact O(2n), and no matter what the events are, the complexity order can not be decreased. A much efficient method namely Recursive Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (RIEP) was constructed by rearranging its equation to its recursive form. The computation complexity is also O(2n) in the worse cases, but it usually has 10 times efficiency than IEP in the normal cases. This paper proposed a novel reduction method for the RIEP to calculate the probability of union events, which can obtain over 100 times efficiency than RIEP in normal cases, and in the worse cases, it has at least the same complexity as that of RIEP. Some benchmarks on network reliability applications show that the proposed approach is very efficient.",

Using vector and matrix algebra, Castigliano’s second theorem provides a simple and direct approach to the problem. By transforming the flexibility matrix into meaningful submatriees, a unified treatment of space frames is obtained for thermal, concentrated and distributed loads. The method is particularly suitable for automatic computer analysis of continuous space structure ofany configuration. Flexibility matrices for straight and curved members are given and used in an illustrative example.",

    "abstract": "This article presents an energy-momentum integration scheme for the nonlinear dynamic analysis of planar Euler-Bernoulli beams. The co-rotational approach is adopted to describe the kinematics of the beam and Hermitian functions are used to interpolate the local transverse displacements. In this paper, the same kinematic description is used to derive both the elastic and the inertia terms. The classical midpoint rule is used to integrate the dynamic equations. The central idea, to ensure energy and momenta conservation, is to apply the classical midpoint rule to both the kinematic and the strain quantities. This idea, developed by one of the authors in previous work, is applied here in the context of the co-rotational formulation to the first time. By doing so, we circumvent the nonlinear geometric equations relating the displacement to the strain which is the origin of many numerical difficulties. It is rigorously shown that the proposed method conserves the total energy of the system and, in absence of external loads, the linear and angular momenta remain constant. The accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithm, especially in long term dynamics with a very large number of time steps, is assessed through four numerical examples.",

Students in all engineering disciplines where fluid mechanics is a core course should find this textbook stimulating and useful. In some chapters, the nature of the material necessitates a bias towards practical applications in certain engineering disciplines, and the disciplinary area of the author also contributes to the selection and presentation of practical examples throughout the text. In this latter respect, practical examples related to civil engineering applications are particularly prevalent\"–",

The proposed method is unconditionally stable, second-order accurate and asymptotically annihilating. It is spectrally equivalent to Houbolt’s method but is cast in single-step form rather than multi-step form; thus the new algorithm computationally is more convenient. An explicit predictor-correcter algorithm is presented based upon the new implicit scheme. The explicit algorithm is spectraily equivalent to the central difference method. The two new algorithms are merged into an implicit-explicit method, resulting in an improved algorithm for solving structural dynamics problems composed of ’soft’ and ’stiff’ domains.

    "abstract": "Abstract The paper describes a study of incremental‐iterative solution techniques for geometrically non‐linear analyses. The solution methods documented are based on a modified Newton‐Raphson approach, meaning that the tangent stiffness matrix is computed at the commencement of each load step but is then held constant throughout the equilibrium iterations. A consistent mathematical notation is employed in the description of the iterative and load incrementation strategies, enabling the simple inclusion of several solution options in a computer program. The iterative strategies investigated are iteration at constant load, iteration at constant displacement, iteration at constant “arc‐length”, iteration at constant external work, iteration at minimum unbalanced displacement norm, iteration at minimum unbalanced force norm and iteration at constant “weighted response”. The load incrementation schemes investigated include strategies based on the number of iterations required to achieve convergence in the previous load step, strategies based on the “current stiffness parameter” and a strategy based on a parabolic approximation to the load‐deflection response. Criteria for detecting when the applied external load increment should reverse sign are described. A challenging example of a circular arch exhibiting snap‐through (load limit point) behaviour and snap‐back (displacement limit point) behaviour is solved using several different iterative and load incrementation strategies. The performance of the solution schemes is evaluated and conclusions are drawn.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, the rise of hosted Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application programming interfaces (APIs) across both academia and industry has exploded, and simultaneously, microservice architectures have replaced monolithic application platforms for the flexibility and maintainability they offer. These SaaS APIs rely on small, independent and reusable microservices that can be assembled relatively easily into more complex applications. As a result, developers can focus on their own unique functionality and surround it with fully functional, distributed processes developed by other specialists, which they access through APIs. The Tapis framework, a NSF funded project, provides SaaS APIs to allow researchers to achieve faster scientific results, by eliminating the need to set up a complex infrastructure stack. In this paper, we describe the best practices followed to create Tapis APIs using Python and the Stream API as an example implementation illustrating authorization and authentication with the Tapis Security Kernel, Tenants and Tokens APIs, leveraging OpenAPI v3 specification for the API definitions and docker containerization. Finally, we discuss our deployment strategy with Kubernetes, which is an emerging orchestration technology and the early adopter use cases of the Streams API service.",

The initial research was a direct extension of classical methods of structural analysis which previously had been restricted to one-dimensional elements. The majority of the research conducted was motivated by the need to solve practical problems in Aerospace, Mechanical and Civil Engineering. During this short period the finite element method was extended to the solution of linear and nonlinear problems associated with creep, incremental construction or excavation, crack closing, heat transfer, flow of water in porous media, soil consolidation, dynamic response analysis and computer assisted learning of structural analysis. During the last six years of this period the fields of structural analysis and continuum mechanics were unified.",

    "abstract": "A simple mathematical model for the uniaxial cyclic stress-strain behavior of structural steel is proposed for arbitrary loading histories in the inelastic range. The model uses the monotonic and cyclic stress-strain curves as references and assumes the existence of stress bounds which cannot be exceeded in any given cycle. The movement of the bounds, which is controlled by hardening, softening, and mean stress relaxation, is determined by the strain amplitude of the last excursion and the previous stress-strain history. The rates of hardening, softening, and mean stress relaxation are determined from experimental data. The nonlinear portions of the stress-strain curves are defined by a continuously changing tangent modulus whose magnitude is a function of the distance between the stress bound and the instantaneous Stress. A comparison is made of predicted and experimentally obtained stress-strain histories. Although the model is developed specifically for types of histories associated with seismic excitations (small number of cycles), it should be applicable as well to low cycle fatigue problems involving large numbers of cycles since it is based on the stabilized cyclic stress-strain curve.",

Indeed, bridges to be built in the future will be gigantic, impressive, light and heavy, deep and high, wide and long. They will be challenging major straits, mitigating natural disasters, fighting the power of the wind, of the sea, of the earth, but linking people, countries, continents. They will have to be erected within a short time to improve our daily life as quickly as possible; they will have to be durable and easily maintained. The fantastic boom of the past fifty years in the field of structural engineering will have to be improved in such a way that our infrastructures become definitely sustainable.",

Our ambition, in this paper, is limited to a presentation of an introductory object-oriented finite element package for nonlinear analysis. Our goal is to make a starting package available to newcomers to the object-oriented approach and to provide an answer to the large number of demands for such a program received in recent time.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a method for the quasi-static simulation of flexible cables assembly in the context of automotive industry is presented. The cables geometry and behavior encourage to employ a geometrically exact beam model. The 3D kinematics is then based on the position of the centerline and on the orientation of the cross-sections, which is here represented by rotational quaternions. Their algebraic nature leads to a polynomial form of equilibrium equations. The continuous equations obtained are then discretized by the finite element method and easily recast under quadratic form by introducing additional slave variables. The asymptotic numerical method, a powerful solver for systems of quadratic equations, is then employed for the continuation of the branches of solution. The originality of this paper stands in the combination of all these methods which leads to a fast and accurate tool for the assembly process of cables. This is proved by running several classical validation tests and an industry-like example.",

The major advantage in this description, without problem in finite rotations and with update procedure of incremental rotation in accord to principals numericals programs, is to provide a symetric tangent stiffness matrix leading to quadratic convergence of the incremental solution. Two approaches spatial or material, are illustrated. The finite element matrix with incompatible modes will be done in addition of operator split resolution method. The examples includ not only analyses of simple shell undergoing large rotation, but also cases of post-buckling displacements. We evaluate the results in comparison with total rotation vection method and 5 degree-of-freedom incremental vector.",

    "abstract": "The paper describes a formulation for 3D beams that is based on the SimoReissner geometrically exact theory and conserves both energy and the momenta. However, in the presence of large 3D rotations the concept of invariance of the adopted strain measures with respect to a superimposed rigid-body rotation does not extend automatically from the theory to a finite element implementation and in contrast to earlier developments, the current formulation is specifically designed to inherit this important property. This formulation is based on a standard (configuration-independent) interpolation of tangent-scaled incremental local rotations, which do not include any rigid-body rotation. This interpolation results in a configuration-dependent interpolation of standard incremental (global) rotations.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes neural-fortran, a parallel Fortran framework for neural networks and deep learning. It features a simple interface to construct feed-forward neural networks of arbitrary structure and size, several activation functions, and stochastic gradient descent as the default optimization algorithm. neural-fortran also leverages the Fortran 2018 standard collective subroutines to achieve data-based parallelism on shared- or distributed-memory machines. First, I describe the implementation of neural networks with Fortran derived types, whole-array arithmetic, and collective sum and broadcast operations to achieve parallelism. Second, I demonstrate the use of neural-fortran in an example of recognizing hand-written digits from images. Finally, I evaluate the computational performance in both serial and parallel modes. Ease of use and computational performance are similar to an existing popular machine learning framework, making neural-fortran a viable candidate for further development and use in production.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents improved analytical methods for simulating the nonlinear static and dynamic response of reinforced concrete frames. A new approach in describing the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of reinforced concrete elements is proposed. This approach consists of isolating the basic mechanisms that control the hysteretic behavior of RC members into individual subelements that are connected in series to form the RC member element. A shear subelement is presented in detail in this paper. It describes the shear sliding in the critical regions and the shear distortion along the member. In cases where a substantial axial force is present, the proposed shear subelement is capable of describing the interaction of axial force with the opening and closing of shear cracks. To establish the validity of the proposed model, correlation studies of analytical results with experimental evidence of the load-displacement response of shear critical RC members and subassemblies under static load reversals are conducted. The analytical results generally show very good agreement with experimental results.",

Carbon FRP (CFRP) composites are mainly used for EBR applications whereas glass FRP (GFRP) bars are employed as internal reinforcement of concrete elements. This paper sheds light into the effect of different aggressive environments on the tensile behavior of reinforcing GFRP bars. 356 results of tensile tests of GFRP bars subjected to hot dry and humid air, different alkali environments, salt solutions with various concentrations, and plain and distillated water were collected from the literature. According to the “design by testing” procedure provided by EN 1990, a statistical analysis of the results was carried out to calibrate environmental reduction factors able to provide reliable estimations of the long-term behavior of GFRP bars subjected to different exposure conditions. For a given aggressive environment, a clear and unique degradation trend could not be identified, which points out the need of a standard testing procedure able to provide reliable and repeatable results.",

Elements of the process include description, definition, and quantification of earthquake intensity measures, engineering demand parameters, damage measures, and decision variables. A consistent probabilistic framework underpins the methodology so that the inherent uncertainties in earthquake performance assessment can be represented. The methodology can be implemented directly for performance assessment, or can be used as the basis for establishing simpler performance metrics and criteria for performance-based design.",

    "abstract": "With the goal to facilitate evaluation and mitigation of the risks from natural hazards, the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure’s Computational Modeling, and Simulation Center (NHERI SimCenter) is developing computational workflows for regional hazard simulations. These simulations enable research to combine detailed assessments of individual facilities with comprehensive regional-scale simulations of natural hazard effects. By integration of multi-fidelity and multi-resolution models to assess natural hazard impacts on buildings, infrastructure systems and other constructed facilities, the approach enables the engineering analysis of public policies and socio-economic impacts. Effective development of platforms for high-resolution regional simulations requires modular workflows that can integrate state-of-the-art models with information technologies and high-performance computing resources. In this paper, the modular architecture of the computational workflow models is described and illustrated through testbed applications to evaluate regional building damage under an earthquake and a hurricane scenario. Developed and disseminated as open-source software on the NHERI DesignSafe Cyberinfrastructure, the computational models and workflows are enabling multi-disciplinary collaboration on research to mitigate the effects of natural hazard disasters.",

    "abstract": "This report is a product of the NHERI SimCenter under the auspices of the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). It provides an overview and review of simulation requirements and software tools for natural hazards engineering (NHE) of the built environment. The simulations discussed in this report are an essential component of research to address the three grand challenge areas and associated research questions outlined in the NHERI Science Plan. These grand challenges entail: (1) identifying and quantifying the characteristics of natural hazards that are damaging to civil infrastructure and disruptive to communities; (2) evaluating the physical vulnerability of civil infrastructure and the social vulnerability of populations in at-risk communities; and (3) creation of technologies and tools to design, retrofit, and operate a resilient and sustainable infrastructure for the Nation. Accordingly, required simulation technologies encompass a broad range of phenomena and considerations, from characterization and simulation of natural hazards and their damaging effects on buildings and civil infrastructure, to quantifying the resulting economic losses, disruption, and other consequences on society. Ultimately, the goal is to enable high-fidelity and high-resolution models in regional simulations that can support technological, economic, and policy solutions to mitigate the threat of natural hazards. The natural hazards addressed in this report include earthquakes, tsunami, storm and tornado winds, and storm surge. While not an exhaustive list of all possible natural hazards, these are the hazards addressed under NSF’s NHERI research program. The first chapter of the report provides an introduction to the SimCenter and its goals, including an overview of the plans and status for software tool development. The subsequent chapters of the report are organized into five parts in a sequential fashion, including: (1) simulation methods to characterize the natural hazards; (2) response simulation of structural and geotechnical systems and localized wind and water flows; (3) quantifying the resulting damage and its effects on the performance of buildings, transportation systems, and utility infrastructure systems; (4) strategies and emerging tools to model recovery from natural disasters; and (5) the cross-cutting applications of uncertainty quantification methods and artificial intelligence to NHE. Owing to the broad scope of the simulation topics, this review of the state of the art is presented with the goal of educating and informing researchers—including both simulation tool developers and users—on key requirements and capabilities within each simulation topic. The report is also a guide to the on-going development of simulation capabilities by the NSF NHERI SimCenter. Each chapter of the report begins with a brief overview of the purpose of the simulation component, including a discussion of the goals of the analysis (what is being calculated), the underlying physics or principles involved in the simulation, common modeling assumptions and simplifications, and typical input and output of the simulations. With the aim of taking stock of computational simulation capabilities, informing the NHERI community of research advances to date, and positioning the work of the NHERI SimCenter as it relates to computational simulation, the summaries identify and review commonly used simulation software that is widely known and used for research in academia and industry. Particular emphasis is placed on open-source or other software that is hosted on DesignSafe or is otherwise easily accessible to researchers. Summary tables of the simulation software tools is provided as an appendix to the report. In addition to summarizing the state of the art in the various topic areas, each chapter of the report identifies major research gaps and needs, with the intent that these could motivate research proposals to NSF or other agencies that will lead to future advancements. This report is an update to a State of Art Report that the SimCenter first published in February 2019. This update reflects comments and suggestions that were solicited from leading researchers in NHE. It includes new chapters on disaster recovery modeling and applications of artificial intelligence technologies to NHE. Readers are encouraged to contribute feedback regarding this report and the SimCenter simulation tool development through the online SimCenter Forum at http://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/ . ...",

    "abstract": "Formulation of structural reliability requires selection of probabilistic or physical models, which usually involve parameters to be estimated through statistical inference — a process that invariably introduces uncertainties in parameter estimates. The measure of reliability that incorporates these parameter uncertainties is termed the predictive reliability index. Methods for computing this measure and the corresponding failure probability are introduced. A simple approximate formula is derived for the predictive reliability index, which requires a single solution of the reliability problem together with parameter sensitivities with respect to mean parameter values. The approach also provides measures of the uncertainties inherent in the estimates of the reliability index and the failure probability, which arise from parameter uncertainties. An illustrative example involving component and system problems demonstrates the influence of parameter uncertainties on the predictive reliability index and the accuracy of the simple approximation formula.",

    "abstract": "The review summarises literature to examine the transition from portland limestone cement system to composite ternary binder systems involving limestone. Interest in limestone addition as an ideal component in multicom­ ponent binder systems has surged as evident from the large volume of literature published in the recent past. A ternary blended system, with co-substitution of limestone, has the potential to complement the reaction of the supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs). The direct addition of limestone powder helps to attain higher substitution levels of portland cement clinker, improve early age properties, and supplement SCM’s reactivity. However, the dilution of hydrates could hamper the long-term benefits. In this review, the interaction of fine limestone is classified and elaborated under two broad umbrellas: physical and chemical interactions. The physical interactions can manifest in three ways, namely, filler action, shearing action and improved packing, which alters reaction rate and extent at early ages. The chemical interactions also modify the reaction kinetics and phase assemblage due to nucleation of C-S-H on calcite surfaces, preservation of the ettringite phase and formation of carboaluminates. Two different forms of carboaluminate hydrates — hemicarboaluminate and mono-carboaluminate can be present in the hydrate matrix depending on the balance between carbonate ions and aluminates in the pore solution. Several factors such as replacement level, particle size, choice of SCM, its reactivity and reactive aluminates content, sulphate levels, curing temperature, and duration of curing can control the carboaluminate formation, reaction degree of SCMs and chemical interaction from limestone additions.",

    "abstract": "This article is an attempt at offering a new perspective for the mechanics of solids using Cartan’s moving frames, specifically discussing a mixed variational principle in non-linear elasticity. We treat quantities defined on the co-tangent bundles of reference and deformed configurations as primary unknowns along with deformation. Such a treatment invites compatibility of the fields (defined on the co-tangent bundle) with the base-space (configurations of the solid body) so that the configuration can be realized as a subset of the Euclidean space. Using the moving frame, we rewrite the metric and connection through differential forms. These quantities are further utilized to write the deformation gradient and Cauchy–Green deformation tensor in terms of frame and co-frame fields. The geometric understanding of stress as a co-vector valued 2-form fits squarely within our overall program. We also show that, for a hyperelastic solid, an equation similar to the Doyle–Ericksen formula may be written for the co-vector part of the stress 2-form. Using this kinetic and kinematic understanding, we rewrite a mixed functional in terms of differential forms, whose extremum leads to the compatibility of deformation, constitutive relations, and equations of equilibrium. Finite element exterior calculus is then utilized to construct a finite-dimensional approximation for the differential forms appearing in the variational principle. These approximations are then used to construct a discrete functional which can be numerically extremized. The discretization leads to a mixed model as it involves independent approximations of differential forms related to stress and deformation gradient. The mixed variational principle is then specialized for the 2D case, whose discrete approximation is applied to problems in nonlinear elasticity. From the numerical study, it is found that the present discretization does not suffer from locking and related convergence issues.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to reveal the unique dynamic characteristics of the Saint-Bachi suspension pipeline bridge with fluid–structure interaction. With commercial software, a three-dimensional finite-element (FE) model of this bridge is developed to simulate its dynamic properties. The solid and fluid elements are, respectively, applied to model the structural members (pipe girder, cables, and portal frames) of the bridge and the water in the pipe girder. The dry (without fluid) and wet (with fluid) modes of the suspension pipeline bridge are, respectively, calculated and compared. The dry modes are fundamentally the same as those of the ordinary highway suspension bridges. The number of wet modes has been greatly increased due to the interaction between sloshing water and structure. According to the oscillation phases of sloshing fluid and pipe girder, the wet modes can be divided into the in-phase, out-of-phase, and no-sloshing modes. The in-phase and out-of-phase modes represent the synchronous and unsynchronous motions of pipe girder and fluid, respectively. The no-sloshing mode denotes a pure girder bending vibration without water sloshing. The in-phase (synchronous) frequencies are decreased with increased fluid depth. The out-of-phase (unsynchronous) frequencies might be increased or decreased with increased fluid depth. The (local) wet frequencies of pylons and cables may increase with the increment of water depth due to increased tension force of the cables.

    "abstract": "In this paper, the dynamic response of the rocking block subjected to base excitation is revisited. The goal is to offer new closed-form solutions and original similarity laws that shed light on the fundamental aspects of the rocking block. The focus is on the transient dynamics of the rocking block under finite-duration excitations. An alternative way to describe the response of the rocking block, informative of the behaviour of rocking structures under excitations of different intensity, is offered. In the process, limitations of standard dimensional analysis, related to the orientations of the involved physical quantities, are revealed. The proposed dimensionless and orientationless groups condense the response and offer a lucid depiction of the rocking phenomenon. When expressed in the appropriate dimensionless–orientationless groups, the rocking response becomes perfectly self-similar for slender blocks (within the small rotations range) and practically self-similar for non-slender blocks (larger rotations). Using this formulation, the nonlinear and non-smooth rocking response to pulse-type ground motion can be directly determined, and need only be scaled by the intensity and frequency of the excitation.",

    "abstract": "Tall buildings and long span bridges exposed to wind undergo complex interactions, which precludes a functional relationship between wind and its load effects. In digital age with burgeoning growth in computational resources and parallel advances in computational fluid dynamics, computational simulations are evolving with a promise of becoming versatile, convenient and reliable means of assessing wind load effects. This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art on the CFD based simulations of wind loads on structures by delineating the differences in the modeling of streamline nature of airfoils versus complex profiles of civil structures. This is followed by highlighting the merits and shortcomings of three modeling schemes central to CFD, i.e. RANS, LES and DNS. Topics related to generation of inflow conditions and fluid-structure interactions are discussed. A case study involving aerodynamic shape sculpting of tall buildings that requires examining several configurations is presented. While such an assessment is currently performed via wind tunnels with limited set of configurations, CFD promises to discover the optimal configuration in a large search space. In closing, future prospects, e.g. advances in multi-fidelity models and the role and propagation of input and modeling uncertainties in CFD simulation are presented.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the simulation of RC members with a three-dimensional (3D), 2-node beam finite element (FE) that includes warping of the cross section. A previously proposed FE formulation is extended to allow the description of structural members with softening material behavior. The governing equations are derived from an extended four-field Hu-Washizu variational principle, with independent interpolation of the warping displacement field from the rigid section displacement, the generalized section deformation, and the material stress fields. A fiber discretization is used for the numerical integration of the nonlinear material response of the composite cross sections with a new plastic-damage model for the material description of the concrete fibers. The element state determination is based on a numerically efficient predictor-corrector scheme for the evolution of the internal variables of damage plasticity. The paper concludes with correlation studies of RC structural members under monotonic and cyclic loading and discusses the effect of cross-section warping on the damage evolution.

The model is based on 1D continuum damage mechanics and relates any 2 work-conjugate response variables such as force-displacement, moment-rotation, or stress-strain. The strength and stiffness deterioration is described by a continuous damage variable. The formulation uses a criterion based on the hysteretic energy and the maximum or minimum deformation for damage initiation with a cumulative probability distribution function for the damage evolution. A series of structural component response simulations showcase the ability of the model to describe different types of hysteretic behavior. The relation of the model’s damage variable to the Park-Ang damage index is also discussed. Because of its consistent and numerically robust formulation, the model is suitable for the large-scale seismic response simulation of structural systems with strength and stiffness deterioration.",

    "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with the behaviour of slender, circular, reinforced-concrete bridge piers in earthquake conditions. The behaviour of the constituent materials and the pier member as a whole were investigated. A literature review of the cyclic stress-strain behaviour of reinforcing steel at quasi-static and dynamic strain rates is given. A test program to test the behaviour of the grades of reinforcing steel produced in New Zealand was conducted an analytical stress-strain model is proposed. A critical literature review of proposed analytical models for unconfined and confined concrete is given as well as the effects of dynamic strain rates. Various conclusions and recommendations are reported. Methods for assessing the ductility capacity and ductility demand of piers are discussed. A review of some proposed methods for designing the confinement steel in the plastic-hinge region of a pier is given. A programme in which fourteen one-sixth scale model bridge piers were tested to destruction on a shake table was carried out. The effects of pier slenderness, the axial-load level, base motion, base fixity, and low-level shaking were investigated. The results of these tests were used to investigate the ability of analytical models which were developed from the observed behaviour of quasi-static test specimens to predict the behaviour and the response of piers subjected to base excitations. It was found that the general pier behaviour can be predicted satisfactorily although the pier strength and stiffness are increased by the dynamic strain rates. The general response can be predicted satisfactorily by inelastic time-history analyses but the peak response is poorly predicted by both inelastic time-history analyses and spectral analyses. The modes of failure of the piers are investigated and the effect of buckling causing the fracture of the longitudinal steel is discussed. The effect of axial-load level and pier slenderness on the length of the plastic hinge is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The theoretical relations between the tension and compression stress-strain curves of ductile metals in the natural coordinate system are presented. In addition, a macroscopic model is formulated to predict the cyclic stress-strain behavior of reinforcing steel. The model is based on the natural coordinate system and represents the Bauschinger effect by a simple expression. It also considers the reduction of the unloading modulus with the plastic strain. Furthermore, the reduction of the ultimate tensile strain is taken solely as a function of the maximum compressive strain when the number of cycles is small enough to ignore the effects of low-cycle fatigue. Data collected from tests on New Zealand manufactured steel grades 300 and 430 were used in the calibration of the model. It is shown that the shape of the Bauschinger effect is dependent on the chemical composition of the steel. It is proposed that a generalization of the calibrated model for use in other reinforcing steel types may be possible by considering the carbon content as a variable.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of methods to detect, locate, and characterize damage in structural and mechanical systems by examining changes in measured vibration response. Research in vibration-based damage identification has been rapidly expanding over the last few years. The basic idea behind this technology is that modal parameters (notably frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping) are functions of the physical properties of the structure (mass, damping, and stiffness). Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based vs. non-model-based methods and linear vs. nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized. The paper concludes with a discussion of critical issues for future research in the area of vibration-based damage identification.",

    "abstract": "Many shear correction factors have appeared since the inception of Timoshenko beam theory in 1921. While rational bases for them have been offered, there continues to be some reluctance to their full acceptance because the explanations are not totally convincing and their efficacies have not been comprehensively evaluated over a range of application. Herein, three-dimensional static and dynamic information and results for a beam of general (both symmetric and non-symmetric) cross-section are brought to bear on these issues. Only homogeneous, isotropic beams are considered. Semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) computer codes provide static and dynamic response data for our purposes. Greater clarification of issues relating to the bases for shear correction factors can be seen. Also, comparisons of numerical results with Timoshenko beam data will show the effectiveness of these factors beyond the range of application of elementary (Bernoulli–Euler) theory. An issue concerning principal shear axes arose in the definition of shear correction factors for non-symmetric cross-sections. In this method, expressions for the shear energies of two transverse forces applied on the cross-section by beam and three-dimensional elasticity theories are equated to determine the shear correction factors. This led to the necessity for principal shear axes. We will argue against this concept and show that when two forces are applied simultaneously to a cross-section, it leads to an inconsistency. Only one force should be used at a time, and two sets of calculations are needed to establish the shear correction factors for a non-symmetrical cross-section.",

The slenderness ratios of built-up members that may buckle out-of-plane, say, about the Y-Y axis for a two-back-toback-angle member are discussed. Based on the LRFD equation (E4-1) and the usual concept of the effective length factor, a modification of the slenderness ratios (Kl/r)m for built-up members as given in the present LRFD Specification is proposed. The proposed formula with local effective length factor Km is concise, simple, and physically clear. It is consistent with the effective length factor recommended by the LRFD Specification, and has only one equation considering the effects of shear and connectors on buckling of built-up members. The calculated results of the proposed formula are found to be in good agreement with available test results.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates the application of the co-rotational method to solve geometrically nonlinear topology optimization problems. The main benefit of this approach is that the tangent stiffness matrix is naturally positive definite, which avoids some numerical issues encountered when using other approaches. Three different methods for constructing the tangent stiffness matrix are investigated: a simplified method, where the linear elastic stiffness matrix is simply rotated; the consistent method, where the tangent stiffness is derived by differentiating residual forces by displacements; and a symmetrized method, where the consistent tangent stiffness is approximated by a symmetric matrix. The co-rotational method is implemented for 2D plane quadrilateral elements and 3-node shell elements. Matlab code is given in the appendix to modify an existing, freely available, density-based topology optimization code so it can solve 2D problems with geometric nonlinear analysis using the co-rotational method. The approach is used to solve four benchmark problems from the literature, including optimizing for stiffness, compliant mechanism design, and a plate problem. The solutions are comparable with those obtained with other methods, demonstrating the potential of the co-rotational method as an alternative approach for geometrically nonlinear topology optimization. However, there are differences between the methods in terms of implementation effort, computational cost, final design, and objective value. In summary, schemes involving the symmetrized tangent stiffness did not outperform the other schemes. For problems where the optimal design has relatively small displacements, then the simplified method is suitable. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the consistent method, as it is the most accurate.",

    "abstract": "The effect of panel zone yielding on the potential for fracture of welded-bolted steel connections is investigated, with the objective of gaining a better understanding of the inelastic behavior of the panel zone region and of critically assessing current seismic provisions for steel panel zone design. The research objectives are addressed through detailed, three-dimensional, nonlinear, finite-element analyses of connection subassemblies. The characteristics of the analysis configurations used in this research are derived from the geometry of a typical pre-Northridge fully restrained beam-colum steel connection. Important geometric parameters are varied over the practical range of interest in order to evaluate their effect on connection behavior. To assess the influence of the parameters of interest, a number of different stress, strain, and combined stress/strain indices are employed. These quantities are sampled at connection plastic rotations ranging from 0.0025 to 0.03 rad. Results from the finite-element analyses show that, although beam plastic rotation demands are smaller in connections with weak panel zones, the stress conditions at the beam-column interface are more critical at higher connection plastic rotations. Therefore, although the panel zone can effectively contribute to overall connection ductility, a weak panel zone can also lead to a greater potential for brittle and/or ductile fracture at higher connection plastic rotations. The finite-element analyses also suggest that current design provisions may not be appropriate when applied to panel zones in exterior joints.",

    "abstract": "This two-part contribution presents a beam theory (BT) with a non-uniform warping (NUW) including the effects of torsion, and shear forces and valid for any homogeneous cross-section made of isotropic elastic material. In part I, the governing equations of the NUW-BT has been established and simplified-NUW-BT versions has been deduced, wherein the number of degrees of freedom is reduced. In this part II, these theories are used to analyze, for a representative set of cross-sections (CS) (solid-CS and thin-walled open/closed-CS, bi-symmetric or not), the elastic behavior of cantilever beams subjected to torsion or shear-bending. For bi-symmetrical-CS, torsion and shear-bending are analyzed separately: analytical and numerical results are given for the distributions along the beam axis of the cross-sectional displacements and stresses, for the NUW-BT and its simplified versions. Numerical results are also given for the three-dimensional stress distributions close to the embedded section: the stress predictions of the NUW-BT are compared to those obtained by threedimensional finite elements computations. It can be drawn from all these results indications that can help to decide when the simplified theories may be applied, and hence when the warping parameters may be reduced. As specified in NUW-BT, torsion and bending are coupled for non-symmetrical-CS, even if the bending moments refer to the centroid while the torsional moment refers to the shear center. To illustrate this coupling effect, the particular example of the channel-CS presented in Kim and Kim [Kim, N.-I., Kim, M.-Y., 2005. Exact dynamic/static stiffness matrices of non-symmetric thin-walled beams considering coupled shear deformation effects. Thin-Walled Structures 43, 701–734.] is analyzed and the results are compared.",

    "abstract": "Automatic differentiation (AD) is a precise, efficient, and convenient method for computing derivatives of functions. Its forwardmode implementation can be quite simple even when extended to compute all of the higher-order derivatives as well. The higherdimensional case has also been tackled, though with extra complexity. This paper develops an implementation of higher-dimensional, higher-order, forward-mode AD in the extremely general and elegant setting of calculus on manifolds and derives that implementation from a simple and precise specification.",

    "abstract": "Automatic differentiation (AD) in reverse mode (RAD) is a central component of deep learning and other uses of large-scale optimization. Commonly used RAD algorithms such as backpropagation, however, are complex and stateful, hindering deep understanding, improvement, and parallel execution. This paper develops a simple, generalized AD algorithm calculated from a simple, natural specification. The general algorithm is then specialized by varying the representation of derivatives. In particular, applying well-known constructions to a naive representation yields two RAD algorithms that are far simpler than previously known. In contrast to commonly used RAD implementations, the algorithms defined here involve no graphs, tapes, variables, partial derivatives, or mutation. They are inherently parallel-friendly, correct by construction, and usable directly from an existing programming language with no need for new data types or programming style, thanks to use of an AD-agnostic compiler plugin.",

The problems associated with modeling bond–slip of anchored reinforcing bars are discussed. The proposed bond–slip model is examined at the element level by comparing its predictions with other analytical and experimental results. The ability of the model to simulate bond deterioration and eventual pullout of anchored reinforcing bars under severe cyclic excitation is demonstrated. This model is incorporated into the global beam–column joint element. Further comparisons are made between the predictions of the proposed beam–column joint model and other analytical and experimental results under reversed cyclic loading to show the validity of the model to describe the bond–slip behavior of the joints.",

The second-order accuracy of this class of algorithms is proved also in the non-linear regime, independently of the quadrature rule for non-linear internal forces. Conversely, the G-stability notion which is suitable for linear multistep schemes devoted to non-linear dynamic problems cannot be applied, as the non-linear structural dynamics equations are not contractive. Nonetheless, it is proved that the Generalized − α methods are endowed with stability in an energy sense and guarantee energy decay in the high-frequency range as well as asymptotic annihilation. However, overshoot and heavy energy oscillations in the intermediate-frequency range are exhibited. The results of representative numerical simulations performed on relatively simple singleand multiple-degrees-of-freedom non-linear systems are presented in order to confirm the analytical estimates.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the application of recent ansatz for estimation of stability of the Laplace resonance for Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede). We estimate over time the eccentricity + semi–major axis in a binary system experiencing the net tidal friction, including the additional tidal heating which comes from the transformation of net transfer of angular momentum between the Galilean moons of Jupiter (due to dynamical features of the Laplace resonance). Presumably, there should be a net transfer of angular momentum between Io and Europa (for the reason that tidal heating on Ganymede seems to be negligible with respect to Io and Europa). We established the fact that Laplace resonance should be valid and stable on a timescale of centuries in the future, but there might be chaotic perturbations less than 0.1% for the accuracy of such phenomenon. Moreover, the presented ansatz can be used to predict a scheme for optimizing the maneuvers of spacecrafts in the vicinity of Ganymede (due to absence of net transfer of angular momentum between Ganymede and other Galilean moons). The main conclusion stems from previously suggested approach (Ershkov 2017a) is that there is a net transfer of angular momentum between Io and Europa, which results in the tidal heating. The main results are also relevant in view of the future mission for the icy moons of Jupiter.",

Meanwhile, the Euler–Poisson system of equations has been successfully explored for the existence of analytical solutions. As the main result, a new ansatz is suggested for solving Euler–Poisson equations: the Euler–Poisson equations are reduced to a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations of first order in regard to three functions i (i = 1, 2, 3); the proper elegant approximate solution has been obtained as a set of quasi-periodic cycles via re-inversing the proper elliptical integral. So the system of Euler–Poisson equations is proved to have analytical solutions (in quadratures) only in classical simplifying cases: (1) Lagrange’s case, or (2) Kovalevskaya’s case or (3) Euler’s case or other well-known but particular cases.",

    "abstract": "This article intends to present a concise theory of spatial nonlinear classical beams followed by a special treatment of the planar case. Hereby the considered classical beams are understood as generalized one-dimensional continua that model the mechanical behavior of three-dimensional beam-like objects. While a onedimensional continuum corresponds to a deformable curve in space, parametrized by a single material coordinate and time, a generalized continuum is augmented by further kinematical quantities depending on the very same parameters. We introduce the following three nonlinear spatial beams: The Timoshenko beam, the Euler–Bernoulli beam and the inextensible Euler–Bernoulli beam. In the spatial theory, the Euler–Bernoulli beam and its inextensible companion are presented as constrained theories. In the planar case, both constrained theories are additionally described using an alternative kinematics that intrinsically satisfies the defining constraints of these theories.",

    "abstract": "The standard in rod finite element formulations is the Bubnov–Galerkin projection method, where the test functions arise from a consistent variation of the ansatz functions. This approach becomes increasingly complex when highly nonlinear ansatz functions are chosen to approximate the rod’s centerline and cross-section orientations. Using a Petrov–Galerkin projection method, we propose a whole family of rod finite element formulations where the nodal generalized virtual displacements and generalized velocities are interpolated instead of using the consistent variations and time derivatives of the ansatz functions. This approach leads to a significant simplification of the expressions in the discrete virtual work functionals. In addition, independent strategies can be chosen for interpolating the nodal centerline points and cross-section orientations. We discuss three objective interpolation strategies and give an in-depth analysis concerning locking and convergence behavior for the whole family of rod finite element formulations.",

    "abstract": "The traditional smeared crack macromodels for the analysis of masonry structures consider masonry as a homogeneous material with the effects of mortar joints included in an average sense. This approach, suitable for the analysis of large structures, implicitly excludes the possibility of representing local elastic and inelastic mechanisms involving mortar joints. In this study, an innovative formulation based on the disturbed stress field model (DSFM) is proposed for the analysis of unreinforced masonry structures. The advancement introduced by the model lies in the possibility of simulating the global average behavior of the composite material in combination with the local nonlinear shear slip response of both bed and head joints. This paper describes the formulation of the model; as well, it presents results obtained from the simulation of tests performed on shear walls demonstrating the ability of the DSFM to reproduce the structural response of masonry structures.

The analysis approach includes different features such as nonlinear curves for capturing the shape of the unloading/reloading branches, both in case of full unloading from the envelope curve and partial unloading/reloading. A unified model for predicting the residual plastic strain as a function of the strain recovered during unloading is also proposed. Particular attention is paid to the stiffness degradation occurring during reloading and to the prediction of the stress and strain values at which the reloading branch intersects the envelope. The calibration of most of the proposed formulations is based on experimental results reported in the literature, as well as from two uniaxial cyclic compression tests carried out within the present work. Finally, the model effectiveness is tested with some verification examples. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0001961. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

    "abstract": "Long-span bridges have traditionally employed suspension or cable-stayed forms, comprising vertical pylons and networks of cables supporting a bridge deck. However, the optimality of such forms over very long spans appears never to have been rigorously assessed, and the theoretically optimal form for a given span carrying gravity loading has remained unknown. To address this we here describe a new numerical layout optimization procedure capable of intrinsically modelling the self-weight of the constituent structural elements, and use this to identify the form requiring the minimum volume of material for a given span. The bridge forms identified are complex and differ markedly to traditional suspension and cable-stayed bridge forms. Simplified variants incorporating split pylons are also presented. Although these would still be challenging to construct in practice, a benefit is that they are capable of spanning much greater distances for a given volume of material than traditional suspension and cable-stayed forms employing vertical pylons, particularly when very long spans (e.g. over 2 km) are involved.",

It explains how to model a rigid-body system and how to analyze it, and it presents the most comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms to be found in a single source. The use of spatial vector notation greatly reduces the volume of algebra which allows systems to be described using fewer equations and fewer quantities. It also allows problems to be solved in fewer steps, and solutions to be expressed more succinctly. In addition algorithms are explained simply and clearly, and are expressed in a compact form. The use of spatial vector notation facilitates the implementation of dynamics algorithms on a computer: shorter, simpler code that is easier to write, understand and debug, with no loss of efficiency.\" \"Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms is aimed at readers who already have some elementary knowledge of rigid-body dynamics, and are interested in calculating the dynamics of a rigid-body system. This book serves as an algorithms recipe book as well as a guide to the analysis and deeper understanding of rigid-body systems.\"–BOOK JACKET",

    "abstract": "This article considers a generalization of the classical structural flexibility matrix. It expands on previous papers by taking a deeper look at computational considerations at the substructure level. Direct or indirect computation of flexibilities as “‘influence coefficients’” has traditionally required pre-removal of rigid body modes by imposing appropriate support conditions, mimicking experimental arrangements. With the method presented here the flexibility of an individual element or substructure is directly obtained as a particular generalized inverse of the free–free stiffness matrix. This generalized inverse preserves the stiffness spectrum. The definition is element independent and only involves access to the stiffness generated by a standard finite element program and the separate construction of an orthonormal rigid-body mode basis. The free–free flexibility has proven useful in special application areas of finite element structural analysis, notably massively parallel processing, model reduction and damage localization. It can be computed by solving sets of linear equations and does not require processing an eigenproblem or performing a singular value decomposition. If substructures contain thousands of d.o.f., exploitation of the stiffness sparseness is important. For that case this paper presents a computation procedure based on an exact penalty method, and a projected rankregularized inverse stiffness with diagonal entries inserted by the sparse factorization process. These entries can be physically interpreted as penalty springs.

    "abstract": "This article presents a unified theoretical framework for the corotational (CR) formulation of finite elements in geometrically nonlinear structural analysis. The key assumptions behind CR are: (i) strains from a corotated configuration are small while (ii) the magnitude of rotations from a base configuration is not restricted. Following a historical outline the basic steps of the Element Independent CR formulation are presented. The element internal force and consistent tangent stiffness matrix are derived by taking variations of the internal energy with respect to nodal freedoms. It is shown that this framework permits the derivation of a set of CR variants through selective simplifications. This set includes some previously used by other investigators. The different variants are compared with respect to a set of desirable qualities, including self-equilibrium in the deformed configuration, tangent stiffness consistency, invariance, symmetrizability, and element independence.

    "abstract": "Several methods to derive accurate Timoshenko beam finite elements are presented and compared. Two application problems are examined: linear elastostatics and linearized prebuckling (LPB) stability analysis. Accurate elements can be derived for both problems using a well known technique that long preceeds the Finite Element Method: using homogeneous solutions of the governing equations as shape functions. An interesting question is: can accurate elements be derived with simpler assumptions? In particular, can linear-linear interpolation of displacements and rotations with one-point integration reproduce those elements? The answers are: no if standard variational tools based on classical functionals are used, but yes if modified functionals are introduced. The connection of modified functionals to newer methods, in particular templates, modified differential equations and Finite Increment Calculus (FIC) are examined. The results brings closure to a 50-year conumdrum centered on this particular finite element model. In addition, the discovery of modified functionals provides motivation for extending these methods to full geometrically nonlinear analysis while still using inexpensive numerical integration.",

For the treatment of the latter, emphasis is placed on partitioned analysis procedures. Although the subject emerged in the present form over 20 years ago, the time-consuming study of competing formulations and implementations can be streamlined through a relatively recent tool: computer algebra systems available on inexpensive desktop and laptop computers. The presentation of the lectures emphasizes that symbiosis between human and machine.",

    "abstract": "Study of collapse-resisting properties of structures has attracted widespread attention because of frequently occurring earthquakes and extreme events (e.g. blast) around the world. The developments in computational methods have enabled researchers to numerically simulate the collapse of structures under different kinds of loadings and provide reliable assessments of the collapse performance of structures. The dynamic nature of structural collapse requires a direct integration algorithm to solve the equations of motion of the numerical simulation model. A major concern in such simulations is the computational efficiency, which stems from the need to use a small time step size in both implicit algorithm and explicit algorithm. In this paper, modeling techniques to simulate typical failure mechanisms in reinforced concrete frame structures combined with the application of the recently developed explicit, unconditionally stable, parametrically dissipative KR-α integration method to investigate collapse simulation are presented. A fiber beam-column element is used to model the frame members, where the material nonlinearities, especially material softening, are simulated by a plastic damage model combined with a failure criterion. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed collapse simulation technique. The results indicate that the proposed technique provides an accurate result and has exceptional computational efficiency. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The representation of engineering systems in a manner suitable for computer processing is an important aspect of software development for computer aided engineering. The process of abstraction is a well-known technique for developing data representations. Objects are a mechanism for representing data using abstraction, and object-oriented languages are languages for writing programs to manipulate objects. The paper shows through examples the advantages of object-oriented programming for developing engineering software. Mathematical graphs are used as an abstraction for two problems: (1) sorting activities in a schedule and (2) ordering nodes and elements in a finite element mesh. Classes of objects are developed for generic graphs, activity procedence graphs, and graphs of finite elements meshes. Object-oriented program development leads to modular programs and a substantial reuse of code for the two problems.",

    "abstract": "Concrete nuclear structures have been identified as suffering from alkali aggregate reaction (AAR) in both Canada and the United States. Although much research effort has been directed toward understanding its effect on reinforced concrete structures, unresolved issues still remain. Among them are the effect of multiaxial stress states, commonly developed in nuclear structures, on the response of AAR-affected concrete; also of concern is the possible invalidity of conventional methods of analysis for structural assessment due to the induced anisotropy in the mechanical properties of concrete. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission initiated and funded an extensive study aimed to reveal the implications of concrete deterioration due to AAR on structural integrity, which included material and structural testing and modeling. This paper presents an overview of the entire research program and discusses the key results.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the use of an automated cyber-physical system (CPS) framework for the design and optimization of tall building dynamics through aeroelastic boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) testing. The framework is fully automated, integrating experimental BLWT modeling with numerical optimization algorithms to rapidly evaluate a wide range of candidate designs. In this study, candidate tall building designs are generated by physically adjusting the dynamic properties of a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) aeroelastic model. The specimen is equipped with an actuation system consisting of a series of variable stiffness devices (VSD), which enable precise control of the lower natural frequencies. The specimen is also instrumented with accelerometers and displacement sensors to capture wind-induced building response. A stochastic optimization algorithm evaluates the fitness of each candidate design based on code-based and/or user-specified serviceability limit states related to occupant comfort and building drift (e.g., sway). Wind tunnel experiments were conducted at the University of Florida Natural Hazard Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Experimental Facility. Results show that the CPS framework can reliably drive the aeroelastic specimen to the optimal solution which minimizes stiffness (i.e., natural frequency) while satisfying multiple acceleration and drift constraints.",

This method permits the replacement of the original member of variable stiffness EJX with one of uniform stiffness EJi, whose elastic line is identical to that of the original variable stiffness member. An exact, as well as a very accurate approximate solution is obtained that drastically reduces the mathematical complexity of the problem.

The stress and deflection characteristics of such members are determined by the method of the equivalent systems, which permits to replace the original member of variable stiffness with one of uniform stiffness, whose elastic line is identical to the one of the original variable stiffness member. It is proven mathematically that the inelastic analysis of members with continuously varying moment of inertia and modulus of elasticity can be carried out by using equivalent linear systems of constant stiffness and applying known handbook formulas or methods of linear elementary mechanics.

Based on virtual power of internal stresses, we show that such a configuration space is the (globally) symmetric space of symmetric positive-definite real matrices. From this unifying point of view, we shall analyse the logarithmic strain, the stress rate, as well as linearization and intrinsic integration of corresponding evolution equation.",

    "abstract": "In connection with the origin of computational mechanics and consequent progress of incremental methods, a fundamental problem came up even in solid mechanics – namely how to correctly timelinearize and time-integrate deformation processes within finite deformations. Contrary to small deformations (actually infinitesimal), which represent a correction of an initial configuration in terms of tensor fields and so a description by means of a linear vector space of all symmetric matrices symð3; RÞ is well-fitting, a situation with finite deformations is rather more complicated. In fact, while the position and shape of a deformed body take place in the usual three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, a corresponding progress of deformation tensor makes up a trajectory in Sym þ ð3; RÞ – a negatively curved Riemannian symmetric manifold. Since this space is not a linear vector space, we cannot simply employ tools from the theory of small deformations, but in order to analyze deformation processes correctly, we have to resort to the corresponding tools from the differential geometry and Lie group theory which are capable of handling the very geometric nature of this space. The paper first briefly recalls a common approach to solid mechanics and then its formulation as a simple Lagrangian system with configuration space Sym þ ð3; RÞ. After a detailed exposition of the geometry of the configuration space, we finally sum up its consequences for the time-incremental analysis, resulting in clear and unambiguous conclusions. & 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Open data sets exist, but they are limited in their span (how much data is available) and context (what kind of data is available and how it is described). Evaluation of such analytics is also limited by how the analytics themselves are implemented, often using hard-coded names of building components, points and locations, or unique input data formats.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an exact solution to the Timoshenko beam theory (TBT) for bending, secondorder analysis, and stability. The TBT covers cases associated with small deflections based on shear deformation considerations, whereas the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory neglects shear deformations. A material law (a moment−shear force−curvature equation) combining bending and shear is presented, together with closed-form solutions based on this material law. A bending analysis of a Timoshenko beam was conducted, and buckling loads were determined on the basis of the bending shear factor. First-order element stiffness matrices were calculated. Finally second-order element stiffness matrices were deduced on the basis of the same principle.",

    "abstract": "General features of the hysteretic behavior of wood joints and structural systems are characterized, and the available hysteresis models for wood systems are reviewed. A general hysteresis model for single- and multiple-degree-of-freedom wood joints and structural systems, based on a modification of the Bouc-WenBaber-Noori model, is presented and used in nonlinear dynamic analysis of single-degree-of-freedom wood systems. The hysteretic constitutive law produces a smoothly varying hysteresis that models previously observed behavior of wood joints and structural systems, such as nonlinearity, strength and stiffness degradation, and pinching. It takes into account the experimentally observed dependence of wood joints’ response to the input and response at an earlier time (known as memory). Hysteresis shapes produced by the model are shown to compare favorably with experimental hysteresis of wood joints with (1) yielding plates; (2) yielding nails; and (3) yielding bolts.",

    "abstract": "A single asymptotic derivation of three classical nonlinear plate theories is presented in a setting which preserves the frame-invariance properties of threedimensional finite elasticity. By a successive scaling of the external loading on the three-dimensional body, the nonlinear membrane theory, the nonlinear inextensional theory and the von K~rm~in equations are derived as the leadingorder terms in the asymptotic expansion of finite elasticity. The governing equations of the nonlinear inextensional theory are of particular interest where 1) plane-strain kinematics and plane-stress constitutive equations are derived simultaneously from the asymptotic analysis, 2) the theory can be phrased as a minimization problem over the space of isometric deformations of a surface, and 3) the local equilibrium equations are identical to those arising in the onedirector Cosserat shell model. Furthermore, it can be concluded that with a regular, single-scale asymptotic expansion it is not possible to obtain a system of plate equations in which finite membrane strain and finite bending strain occur simultaneously in the leading-order term of an asymptotic analysis.",

We make the acquaintence of three classes of methods: Runge-Kutta, multistep, and vector-field splitting methods; and analyze their approximation properties and convergence. For integrations on intervals, we discuss important aspects of asymptototic behavior, such as linear stability of equilibria and preservation of invariant sets. As a unique aspect, we give special attention to the parallels between our subject and the theories of continuous and discrete dynamical systems. Such methods enjoy wide-spread use in applications such as mathematical physics, biology and finance, from which we draw examples.",

JAX uses the XLA compiler infrastructure to generate optimized code for the program subroutines that are most favorable for acceleration, and these optimized subroutines can be called and orchestrated by arbitrary Python. Because the system is fully compatible with Autograd, it allows forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation of Python functions to arbitrary order. Because JAX supports structured control flow, it can generate code for sophisticated machine learning algorithms while maintaining high performance. We show that by combining JAX with Autograd and Numpy we get an easily programmable and highly performant ML system that targets CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, capable of scaling to multi-core Cloud TPUs.",

A geometric interpretation of the resulting expression is provided, as well as its agreement with other less-compact but better-known formulas.

We hope by providing this more compact expression to alleviate the common pressure to reluctantly resort to alternative representations in various computational applications simply as a means to avoid the complexity of differential analysis in exponential coordinates.",

    "abstract": "In this data explosion epoch, structural health monitoring and rapid damage assessment after natural hazards have become new focuses in civil engineering. In this paper, state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) techniques were introduced and implemented for image-based structural damage recognition by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Residual Network (ResNet). First, a new ImageNet, namely Structural ImageNet, was proposed for the benchmarking and assessment of progress in vision-based problems in structural engineering area. A hierarchy tree like evaluation procedure was planned for Structural ImageNet, and four simplified baseline detection tasks were designed and tested: component type, spalling condition, damage level and damage type. Selected from the database, a small experimental dataset was established with 2000 manually labeled images based on domain knowledge. Due to the relatively small number of labeled images, instead of training CNN from scratch, Transfer Learning (TL) approach was applied in two different ways with feature extractor (FE) and fine-tuning (FT). Four recognition experiments were conducted on different configurations of ResNet by both FE and FT. Our results show that both the FE and FT approach created highly accurate neural network classifiers. In the visualization and explanation section, we use local linear approximations of the model to interpret and explain the model’s behavior with respect to the images. In summary, it is demonstrated that deep CNN realizes structural damage recognition through image in a quite accurate way. Furthermore, establishment of a larger Structural ImageNet and application of more complicated tasks such as damage localization are proposed as seed of future work.",

    "abstract": "Today, bridge design seeks not only to minimize cost, but also to minimize adverse environmental and social impacts. This multi-criteria decision-making problem is subject to variability of the opinions of stakeholders regarding the importance of criteria for sustainability. As a result, this paper proposes a method for designing and selecting optimally sustainable bridges under the uncertainty of criteria comparison. A Pareto set of solutions is obtained using a metamodel-assisted multi-objective optimization. A new decision-making technique introduces the uncertainty of the decision-maker’s preference through triangular distributions and thereby ranks the sustainable bridge designs. The method is illustrated by a case study of a three-span post-tensioned concrete box-girder bridge designed according to the embodied energy, overall safety and corrosion initiation time. In this particular case, 211 efficient solutions are reduced to two preferred solutions which have a probability of being selected of 81.6% and 18.4%. In addition, a sensitivity analysis validates the influence of the uncertainty regarding the decisionmaking. The approach proposed allows actors involved in the bridge design and decision-making to determine the best sustainable design by finding the probability of a given design being chosen.",

Bayesian updating is used to assess the unknown model parameters based on observational data. The approach properly accounts for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. The methodology is used to construct univariate and bivariate probabilistic models for deformation and shear capacities of circular reinforced concrete columns subjected to cyclic loads based on a large body of existing experimental observations. The probabilistic capacity models are used to estimate the fragility of structural components. Point and interval estimates of the fragility are formulated that implicitly or explicitly reflect the influence of epistemic uncertainties.

However, the reactivity is often assessed, by the concrete prism test as specified in ASTM C1293, for a particular grading of coarse aggregate that may deviate from the aggregate grading in field concrete. This study investigated the effects of coarse aggregate grading on the ASR expansion and damage of concrete. The results indicated that a deviation of 10% in the grading of reactive coarse aggregate could result in up to 50% larger concrete expansion compared to concrete with standard (ASTM C1293) grading. Aggregate grading also significantly influenced the ASR damage of concrete as measured by the damage rating index method. Furthermore, aggregate grading influenced the quality of concrete. Aggregate grading remains an important parameter in the study of the reactivity of aggregates and the ASR performance of concrete.",

The considerations are restricted to “frictionless” quasi-static processes, small strains and piecewise linear approximations of the yield and clearance surfaces. The results of numerical experiments for several illustrative examples are presented, including the unilateral contact problem between an elastic-perfectly plastic beam and an elastic±perfectly plastic foundation. In the analysis the discrete FEM-oriented mathematical model [A. Gawe° cki, Elasto-plasticity of slackened systems, Arch. Mech. 1992;44:363± 390 was employed. # 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The discretized equations of motion are formulated using the augmented lagrangian approach and are solved in an implicit manner. Symbolic computation is utilized to develop the element models. Flexible members are treated in two ways: either in a fully nonlinear manner using a geometrically exact beam model, or through the substructuring concept. Two complex joint models are presented: a cam pair with double curvature and a flexible slider. Dry friction effects are taken into account using a regularization procedure.",

By adopting an algebraic point of view, they many also be regarded as linear transformations with invariance properties. They can thus be described in terms of a minimal set of parameters, the choice of which is very wide. The objective of the paper is to make a general presentation of finite and differential motion kinematics in algebraic fonn and to discuss different methods of parametrization. The proposed concepts are then applied to develop an energy conserving time integration strategy to compute the long term response of a spinning top in a gravity field.",

Continued digitization of the industry offers the opportunity to totally reinvent contemporary construction design and delivery practice for future development. Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the context of Architecture, Engineering & Construction (AEC) has been developing since the early 2000s and is considered to be a key technology. Despite major technical advancements in BIM, it has not been fully adopted and its definitive benefits have not been fully capitalized upon by industry stakeholders. The lack of widespread uptake of BIM appears to be linked to the risks and challenges that are potentially impeding its effectiveness. This paper aims to discuss the reality of BIM, its widespread benefits and current level of uptake. The risks and challenges associated with the adoption of BIM, as well as recommendations regarding how future BIM adoption could be developed are also highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Rapid post-earthquake damage diagnosis of bridges can guide decision-making for emergency response management and recovery. This can be facilitated using digital technologies to remove the barriers of manual post-event inspections. Prior mechanics-based Finite Element (FE) models can be used for post-event response simulation using the measured ground motions at nearby stations; however, the damage assessment outcomes would suffer from uncertainties in structural and soil material properties, input excitations, etc. For instrumented bridges, these uncertainties can be reduced by integrating sensory data with prior models through a model updating approach. This study presents a sequential Bayesian model updating technique, through which a linear/nonlinear FE model, including soil-structure interaction effects, and the foundation input motions are jointly identified from measured acceleration responses. The efficacy of the presented model updating technique is first examined through a numerical verification study. Then, seismic data recorded from the San Rogue Canyon Bridge in California are used for a real-world case study. Comparison between the free-field and the foundation input motions reveals valuable information regarding the soil-structure interaction effects at the bridge site. Moreover, the reasonable agreement between the recorded and estimated bridge responses shows the potentials of the presented model updating technique for real-world applications. The described process is a practice of digital twinning and the updated FE model is considered as the digital twin of the bridge and can be used to analyze the bridge and monitor the structural response at element, section, and fiber levels to diagnose the location and severity of any potential damage mechanism.",

    "abstract": "While frame-invariant solutions for arbitrarily large rotational deformations have been reported through the orthogonal matrix parametrization, derivation of such solutions purely through a rotation vector parametrization, which uses only three parameters and provides a parsimonious storage of rotations, is novel and constitutes the subject of this paper. In particular, we employ interpolations of relative rotations and a new rotation vector update for a strain-objective finite element formulation in the material framework. We show that the update provides either the desired rotation vector or its complement. This rules out an additive interpolation of total rotation vectors at the nodes. Hence, interpolations of relative rotation vectors are used. Through numerical examples, we show that combining the proposed update with interpolations of relative rotations yields frame-invariant and path-independent numerical solutions. Advantages of the present approach vis-a-vis the updated Lagrangian formulation are also analyzed.",

    "abstract": "In computational mechanics, finite rotations are often represented by rotation vectors. Rotation vector increments corresponding to different tangent spaces are generally related by a linear operator, known as the tangential transformation T. In this note, we derive the higher order terms that are usually left out in linear relation. The exact nonlinear relation is also presented. Errors via the linearized T are numerically estimated. While the concept of T arises out of the nonlinear characteristics of the rotation manifold, it has been derived via tensor analysis in the context of computational mechanics (Cardona and Géradin, 1988). We investigate the operator T from a Lie group perspective, which provides a better insight and a 1–1 correspondence between approaches based on tensor analysis and the standard matrix Lie group theory.",

Soil properties are directly mapped from model parameters to an equivalent lumped mass model of the soil interval. Shear stiffness and damping ratios were calculated for 8 events with ML ranging from 4.5 to 7.0. Shear stiffness ranged between 0.5 and 6 MN/m, inversely proportional to PGA. The equivalent viscous damping ratio varied from 2 to 30% of critical damping, proportional to PGA. Degradation of soil behavior, while less pronounced with increasing depth, consistently occurs above a peak input acceleration of 0.07 g. Although ªnon-linearº behavior is evident above 0.17 g, Event 7 (0.21 g) is accurately predicted using a linear constant parameter model estimated from the smaller Event 8 aftershock ground motions. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

    "abstract": "The “actual” capacity and stiffness values of the abutment-soil systems at the US 101/Painter Street Overpass, determined from its earthquake motions, are used to investigate how abutment stiffness varies during earthquakes and to evaluate current modeling procedures. It is found that the “actual” abutment stiffness may be significantly different during different phases of the shaking and decreases significantly as the abutment deformation increases. The CALTRANS modeling procedure leads to a good estimate of the transverse abutment stiffness and capacity. However, this procedure may overestimate the normal abutment stiffness and capacity by a factor of over two, indicating that the assumed value of 7.7 ksf for the ultimate passive resistance of the soil, used in the CALTRANS procedure, may be too high. The AASHTO-83 and ATC-6 procedures lead to an initial estimate of the abutment stiffness that is too high in both directions.",

The integration of physical models, feature extraction techniques, uncertainty management, parameter estimation, and finite element model analysis are used to implement data-driven model detection systems for SHM system design. A total of 68 articles using ANN, CNN and SVM, in combination with preprocessing techniques, were analyzed corresponding to the period 2011–2022. The application of these techniques in structural condition monitoring improves the reliability and performance of these systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed comparison of two implicit time integration schemes for a simple non-linear Hamiltonian system with symmetry: the motion of a particle in a central force field. The goal is to cstablisb analytical and numerical results pertaining to the stability properties of the implicit mid-point rule (the proto-typical implicit symplectic method) and a particular energy-momentum conserving scheme, and to compare the two schemes with respect to accuracy. While all results presented herein are withm the context of a simple model problem, the problem was constructed so as to exhibit key features typical of more complex systems with symmetry such as those arising in non-linear solid mechanic.;: namely, the presence of large (and relatively slow) overall motions together with high-frequency internal motions.",

    "abstract": "We present a method with domain decomposition to solve time-dependent non-linear problems. This method enables arbitrary numeric schemes of the Newmark family to be coupled with di erent time steps in each subdomain: this coupling is achieved by prescribing continuity of velocities at the interface. We are more speciÿcally interested in the coupling of implicit-explicit numeric schemes taking into account material and geometric non-linearities. The interfaces are modelled using a dual Schur formulation where the Lagrange multipliers represent the interfacial forces. Unlike the continuous formulation, the discretized formulation of the dynamic problem is unable to verify simultaneously the continuity of displacements, velocities and accelerations at the interfaces. We show that, within the framework of the Newmark family of numeric schemes, continuity of velocities at the interfaces enables the deÿnition of an algorithm which is stable for all cases envisaged. To prove this stability, we use an energy method, i.e. a global method over the whole time interval, in order to verify the algorithms properties. Then, we propose to extend this to non-linear situations in the following cases: implicit linear=explicit non-linear, explicit non-linear=explicit non-linear and implicit non-linear=explicit non-linear. Finally, we present some examples showing the feasibility of the method. Copyright ? 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "This paper is based on the work of GREEN& LAWSwho have givena generalthermodynamical theory of rods which is valid for any material. Here, starting with the general non-linear theory of elastic rods, we derive a linear theory allowing for thermal effects. The resulting free energy as a quadratic function of kinematic variables is restricted by certain symmetry conditions. The basic equations then separate into four groups, two for flexure, one for torsion and one for extension of the rod with temperature effectsoccurring only in the latter group. Wave propagation along an infinite rod is considered. There are two wave speeds for each type of flexure, two for torsion and three for isothermal extension and all wave speeds depend on the wave length.",

The three-dimensional theory is reduced to a two-dimensional theory for a shell, or plate, and a one-dimensional theory for a rod by employing an exact expansion for the displacement but an approximation for the temperature. For elastic rods and shells a method of approximation is suggested which brings the respective theories into correspondence with those of Green and Laws (l) and Green, Naghdi and Wainwright(2).",

    "abstract": "When performing system identification, it can be possible to realise a deficient model (i.e. one that will make low fidelity predictions) that is able to closely represent a set of training data. For example, the parameters of linear dynamical models can often be tuned to realise a close match to training data that was generated from a system with strong nonlinearities. Despite this close match to available data, these same models may make very poor-quality predictions when shifted even slightly from the “validation domain” (which could, for example, be a specific time window). In this paper we investigate the hypothesis that, by treating our model’s parameters as being time-varying, we can identify key weaknesses in a model that would have been difficult to establish using other identification methods that do not consider the potentially time-varying nature of the model’s parameters. Specifically, we use an Extended Kalman Filter to “track” the parameters of a dynamical system, as a time history of training data is analysed. We then illustrate that this approach can reveal important information about the potential deficiencies of a model.",

Based on a Timoshenko beam kinematic, the strain measures are derived by exploitation of the Green-Lagrangean strain tensor. Thus, the formulation is conformed with existing nonlinear shell theories. Finite rotations are described by orthogonal transformations of the basis systems from the initial to the current configuration. Since for arbitrary cross-sections the centroid and shear center do not coincide, torsion bending coupling occurs in the linear as well as in the finite deformation case. The linearization of the boundary value formulation leads to a symmetric bilinear form for conservative loads. The resulting finite element model is characterized by 6 degrees of freedom at the nodes and therefore is fully compatible with existing shell elements. Since the reference curve lies arbitrarily to the line of centroids, the element can be used to model eccentric stiffener of shells with arbitrary cross-sections. 0 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

    "abstract": "In this paper the approximate computation of shear stresses in prismatic beams due to Saint–Venant torsion and bending using the nite element method is investigated. The shape of the considered cross-sections may be arbitrary. Furthermore, the basic co-ordinate system lies arbitrarily to the centroid, and not necessarily in principal directions. For numerical reasons Dirichlet boundary conditions of the exure problem are transformed into Neumann boundary conditions introducing a conjugate stress function. Based on the weak formulation of the boundary value problem isoparametric nite elements are formulated. The developed procedure yields the relevant warping and torsion constants.

    "abstract": "A theory of space curved beams with arbitrary cross-sections and an associated nite element formulation is presented. Within the present beam theory the reference point, the centroid, the centre of shear and the loading point are arbitrary points of the cross-section. The beam strains are based on a kinematic assumption where torsion-warping deformation is included. Each node of the derived nite element possesses seven degrees of freedom. The update of the rotational parameters at the nite element nodes is achieved in an additive way. Applying the isoparametric concept the kinematic quantities are approximated using Lagrangian interpolation functions. Since the reference curve lies arbitrarily with respect to the centroid the developed element can be used to discretize eccentric sti ener of shells. Due to the implemented constitutive equations for elastoplastic material behaviour the element can be used to evaluate the load-carrying capacity of beam structures.

    "abstract": "To deal with the growing complexity of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models, a partial model has always been proposed as an effective way to satisfy users’ specific requirements by tailoring the central model. The traditional approaches with IFC-validated partial models have the problems of high structural complexity and low data density. This paper proposes an IFC property–based model generation method to support domain-specific data extraction with a property-based model view definition (MVD). This approach removes datairrelevant IFC definitions while keeping data links between the view and the IFC central model. Based on the MVD, an algorithm is designed to extract the required properties from the central IFC model by recursively iterating through IFC data instances for two types of properties. The proposed approach has been implemented on the top of the open source BIMserver platform. Its feasibility and efficiency have been validated through a set of practical examples. Compared to central IFC model and IFC-validated partial model approach, the experiment results show that our proposed approach achieves the smallest model size, the fastest speed for model loading, the least memory usage, and the lowest network transmission overhead.

    "abstract": "An analytical procedure was recently developed for the nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete frame structures consisting of beams, columns, and shear walls under monotonic loading. The procedure is distinct from others because it is capable of inherently and accurately considering shear effects and significant second-order mechanisms with a simple modeling process suitable for use in practice. In this study, the procedure is further developed to enable the performance assessment of shear-critical frame structures under general (arbitrary) loading, including the special cases of cyclic and reversed-cyclic loads. Newly developed and implemented formulations are described and applied to 11 previously tested specimens for verification. Important considerations in nonlinear modeling and the limitations of the procedure are also discussed. The procedure is found to accurately simulate the overall experimental behaviors of the specimens examined. Performance measures, such as load and deformation capacities, stiffnesses, energy dissipations, ductilities, failure modes, crack widths, and reinforcement strains, are typically captured well. The procedure exhibits excellent convergence and numerical stability, requiring little computational time. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000346. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an analytical approach developed for the structural assessment of corrosion-damaged reinforced concrete (RC) structures is presented. The proposed method, suited for finite element analysis, is compatible with smeared rotating crack models and accounts for uniform and pitting corrosion. Modeling corrosion damage involves accounting for the reduction of the cross-sectional area of reinforcement, bond strength degradation between the reinforcement and concrete, deterioration of the reinforcement mechanical properties, and cracking of concrete in the vicinity of the corroded reinforcement. Numerical models and techniques for simulating corrosion damage were incorporated within the algorithms of a nonlinear finite element analysis program. Validation studies successfully reproduced the responses of published experiments on corroded RC beams. Stochastic simulations were also performed, demonstrating the sensitivity of response quantities to changes in various input parameters. The statistics of the response quantities can also be used for reliability analysis by employing methods such as the first-order reliability method.",

    "abstract": "This article is based on the planar beam theories presented in Eugster and Harsch (2020) and deals with the finite element analysis of their presented beam models. A Bubnov-Galerkin method, where B-splines are chosen for both ansatz and test functions, is applied for discretizing the variational formulation of the beam theories. Five different planar beam finite element formulations are presented: The Timoshenko beam, the Euler–Bernoulli beam obtained by enforcing the crosssection’s orthogonality constraint as well as the inextensible Euler–Bernoulli beam by additionally blocking the beam’s extension. Furthermore, the Euler–Bernoulli beam is formulated with a minimal set of kinematical descriptors together with a constrained version that satisfies inextensibility. Whenever possible, the numerical results of the different formulations are compared with analytical and semi-analytical solutions. Additionally, numerical results reported in classical beam finite element literature are collected and reproduced.",

    "abstract": "Numerical models of structural components that deteriorate primarily due to geometric instabilities under multiaxis cyclic loading are sensitive to both the assumed geometric imperfections and the nonlinear material model assumptions. Therefore, the accuracy of the constitutive model is a desirable feature in finite-element simulations. However, the classic Voce-Chaboche metal plasticity model, ubiquitous among commercial finite-element software, is found to underestimate the initial yield stress in structural steels by about 10%–30% when calibrated to minimize the overall difference in strain energy between the model and test data of load protocols representative of earthquake loading. This paper proposes a refined version of the Voce-Chaboche material model. When compared with the original model, the updated one improves the prediction of the initial yield stress, can simulate initial yield plateau behavior, and better estimates experimental cyclic stress-strain data. Constraints on the model parameters are established, a calibration procedure is developed, and model parameters are proposed for nine structural steels used worldwide. Source code for the material model is also made publicly available. A case study demonstrates that steel component behavior is sensitive to subtle differences in the material response that arise between the Voce-Chaboche and the proposed material models.

The main problem is formulated as a bifurcation problem with the undeformed thickness ratio as a parameter, Numerical results are presented for several different material models and, in all cases, we find that there is a critical thickness for the tube. Thinner tubes can be everted to a cylindrical shape, thicker tubes will undergo a bifurcation upon eversion and so the cylindrical shape will not be attained. We find that the length to radius ratio of the tube only plays a significant role for one particular bifurcation mode.",

    "abstract": "Finite element reliability methods allow the analyst to define material, load, and geometry parameters as random variables to represent uncertainties in these model parameters. Approximate probabilistic analysis methods produce estimates of the response variance/ covariances, probabilities of exceeding specified structural performance thresholds, and parameter importance measures. A necessary ingredient for such analysis is consistent, efficient, and accurate algorithms for computing finite element response sensitivities. In this paper, unified response sensitivity equations with respect to material, load, and geometry parameters are developed for the time- and space-discretized finite element model. The sensitivities with respect to nodal coordinates and global shape parameters in the presence of material and geometric nonlinearities represent an extension of previous work. Practical computer implementation issues are emphasized. The equations are implemented in the comprehensive, open-source, object-oriented finite element software OpenSees. Importance measures from reliability analysis, employing the sensitivity results, are presented to enable the investigation of the relative importance of uncertainty in the parameters of a finite element model. Two example applications demonstrate that the variability in nodal coordinates of a structure can be a significant source of uncertainty along with that in key material and load parameters.",

A novelty is the consideration of geometric uncertainty in both the displacement- and force-based finite element formulations of nonlinear beam-column behavior. The shape sensitivity equations enable a comprehensive investigation of the relative influence of uncertain geometrical imperfections on structural reliability assessments. For this purpose, finite element reliability analyses are employed with sophisticated structural models, from which importance measures are available. The unified approach presented herein is based on the direct differentiation method and includes variations in the equilibrium and compatibility relationships of frame finite elements, as well as the member cross-section geometry, in order to obtain complete shape sensitivity equations. The analytical shape sensitivity equations are implemented in the OpenSees software framework. Numerical examples involving a steel structure and a reinforced concrete structure confirm that geometrical imperfections may have a significant impact on structural reliability assessments.",

    "abstract": "An essential step in FORM, SORM and importance sampling reliability methods is the determination of the so-called design point. This point is the solution of a constrained optimization problem in the outcome space of the random variables, which is commonly solved by an iterative, gradient-based search algorithm. In solving this problem in the context of non-linear finite element reliability analysis, two serious impediments are encountered: (a) for certain material models, the constraint function may have a discontinuous gradient, leading to failure of the search algorithm to converge. (b) The search algorithm may generate trial points too far in the failure domain, where the finite element code fails to produce a result due to lack of numerical convergence. In this paper, remedying strategies are developed for both impediments. The first impediment is addressed by using smooth or smoothed material models, including a smoothed bi-linear model, a Bouc–Wen model and a generalized plasticity model. This is complemented by a proof that sudden elastic unloading does not give rise to gradient discontinuities. The second impediment is addressed by modifying or introducing search algorithms that prevent the trial points from overshooting into the failure domain. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the two impediments and effectiveness of the proposed remedies.",

    "abstract": "We review the application of torsion in field theory. First we show how the notion of torsion emerges in differential geometry. In the context of a Cartan circuit, torsion is related to translations similar as curvature to rotations. Cartan’s investigations started by analyzing Einsteins general relativity theory and by taking recourse to the theory of Cosserat continua. In these continua, the points of which carry independent translational and rotational degrees of freedom, there occur, besides ordinary (force) stresses, additionally spin moment stresses. In a 3-dimensional continuized crystal with dislocation lines, a linear connection can be introduced that takes the crystal lattice structure as a basis for parallelism. Such a continuum has similar properties as a Cosserat continuum, and the dislocation density is equal to the torsion of this connection. Subsequently, these ideas are applied to 4-dimensional spacetime. A translational gauge theory of gravity is displayed (in a Weitzenboeck or teleparallel spacetime) as well as the viable Einstein-Cartan theory (in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime). In both theories, the notion of torsion is contained in an essential way. Cartan’s spiral staircase is described as a 3-dimensional Euclidean model for a space with torsion, and eventually some controversial points are discussed regarding the meaning of torsion.",

    "abstract": "The mathematical description of physical phenomena requires the use of scalars and tensors of various order. Since many of the second-order and fourth-order tensors used in continuum mechanics possess certain symmetries, a compressed vector or matrix representation, respectively, is frequently used in computational applications such as the FEM and BEM. Use of dierent storage schemes for dierent tensors lead to an hypothetical nonuniqueness of such matrix representations. The present paper oers a clari®cation by investigation of the structure of the underlying six-dimensional vector space. It identi®es various types of matrix representations as covariant, contravariant or mixed-variant coordinates in that vector space and thus proves consistency of the matrix representation with classical tensor analysis in R3. Furthermore, it is shown that an ortho-normal basis for the underlying tensor representation in R3 does not automatically lead to a normalized space for the compressed matrix representation in R6. Thus, distinction of covariant and contravariant coordinates is necessary even in that case. Theoretical ®ndings are worked out in detail for symmetric second-order and fourth-order tensors in R3. Example applications on commonly used fourth-order tensors as well as a comparison of possible computational implementations close the paper. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "The increasing reliance on computer simulations in decision-making motivates the need to formulate a commonly accepted definition for ‘‘predictive maturity.” The concept of predictive maturity involves quantitative metrics that could prove useful while allocating resources for physical testing and code development. Such metrics should be able to track progress (or lack thereof) as additional knowledge becomes available and is integrated into the simulations for example, through the addition of new experimental datasets during model calibration, and/or through the implementation of better physics models in the codes. This publication contributes to a discussion of attributes that a metric of predictive maturity should exhibit. It is contended that the assessment of predictive maturity must go beyond the goodness-of-fit of the model to the available test data. We firmly believe that predictive maturity must also consider the ‘‘knobs,” or ancillary variables, used to calibrate the model and the degree to which physical experiments cover the domain of applicability. The emphasis herein is placed on translating the proposed attributes into mathematical properties, such as the degree of regularity and asymptotic limits of the maturity function. Altogether these mathematical properties define a set of constraints that the predictive maturity function must satisfy. Based on these constraints, we propose a Predictive Maturity Index (PMI). Physical datasets are used to illustrate how the PMI quantifies the maturity of the non-linear, Preston–Tonks–Wallace model of plastic deformation applied to beryllium, a light-weight, high-strength metal. The question ‘‘does collecting additional data improve predictive power?” is answered by computing the PMI iteratively as additional experimental datasets become available. The results obtained reflect that coverage of the validation domain is as important to predictive maturity as goodness-of-fit. The example treated also indicates that the stabilization of predictive maturity can be observed, provided that enough physical experiments are available.",

However, for many quantities, most notably orientations in 3D, S is not a vector space, but a so-called manifold, i.e. it behaves like a vector space locally but has a more complex global topological structure. For integrating these quantities, several ad-hoc approaches have been proposed.",

    "abstract": "The principle of virtual forces has long been an attractive tool for linear matrix structural analysis because it provides a means to compute the exact flexibility matrix for a linear, elastic, non-prismatic Bernoulli–Euler beam element while the classical stiffness method, based on the principle of virtual displacements, does not. Nonlinear flexibility methods have recently appeared in the literature as a means of improving the accuracy of frame analysis when the curvature fields are more complex than the moment fields (e.g., when inelastic response is important). This paper surveys the basic methods of formulating nonlinear Bernoulli–Euler beam elements based on classical and mixed variational principles. We show that the variational structure provided by the Hellinger–Reissner and Hu–Washizu functionals gives a framework that reaps the benefits of the so-called nonlinear flexibility methods while allowing a standard treatment of non-linear problems by Newton’s method.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

    "abstract": "There have been a number of contributions to the literature on a class of structural analysis methods referred to as nonlinear flexibility methods. These methods appear to perform very well compared to classical stiffness approaches for problems with constitutive nonlinearities. Although most of these methods appeal to variational principles, the exact variational basis of these methods has not been entirely clear. Some of them even seem not to be variationally consistent. We show in this paper that, because the equations of equilibrium and kinematics are directly integrable, a nonlinear flexibility method ͑in the spirit of those presented in the literature͒ can be derived without appeal to variational principles. The method does not involve interpolation of the displacement field and the accuracy of the method is limited only by the numerical scheme used to perform element integrals. There is no need for h refinement to improve accuracy. Further, we show that this nonlinear flexibility method is essentially identical, with some subtle algorithmic differences, to a two-field ͑Hellinger-Reissner͒ variational principle when the stress interpolation is exact ͑which is possible for this class of problems͒. We demonstrate the utility of the nonlinear flexibility method by applying it to a problem involving cyclic inelastic loading wherein the strain fields evolve into functions that are difficult to capture through interpolation.",

    "abstract": "This article provides an overview of some of the mathematical principles of Automatic Differentiation (AD). In particular, we summarise different descriptions of the Forward Mode of AD, like the matrix-vector product based approach, the idea of lifting functions to the algebra of dual numbers, the method of Taylor series expansion on dual numbers and the application of the push-forward operator, and explain why they all reduce to the same actual chain of computations. We further give a short mathematical description of some methods of higher-order Forward AD and, at the end of this paper, briefly describe the Reverse Mode of Automatic Differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In computational mechanics to date, even after five decades of research dealing with integration of the linear and nonlinear dynamic equations of motion, there exists for the general cases of algorithm designs still a clear lack of a fundamental understanding regarding evaluation of these equations of motion, and how, why, and what precise time levels the integrations need to take place. This has placed major limitations on commercial code developers, and a lack of confidence in general, thereby restricting the implementation of LMS methods to only a select few that happen to be correct, but without any rigorous proofs or underlying reasons explaining the ramifications. This is extremely critical for the general cases of integration of the equations of motion, in particular for the class of Linear Multi-Step (LMS) that are implicit, involve a single solve, and are second-order accurate in time with unconditional stability (this pertains to linear dynamic situations only), since these serve as the backbone and drivers for most finite element commercial and research software. In this regard, the present Part I of the three-part exposition puts the matter to rest and provides closure, while in Part II (see Ref [1]) and Part III (see Ref [2]) we describe extensions to nonlinear dynamics applications of the basic general framework for the classes of nondissipative and controllable numerical dissipative methods, respectively. Within the confines of these LMS methods, particular attention is paid to designing algorithms that are symplectic-momentum preserving, and with enhancements to include controllable dissipative features and optimal algorithm designs. Simply for illustration of the basic ideas, readily understandable numerical examples are presented that validate the overall concepts and developments.",

The commonly used spring-dashpot method for analysis of the pile-supported structures under the effect of (SSI) improves to a more capable model. Also, a comprehensive investigation of the dynamic response of a long bridge subjected to spatially varying earthquake ground motions (SVEGM) is performed based on a proposed analytical model which includes the effect of (SSI). The modeling methodology is discussed in detail. To emphasize the importance of the SVEGM and SSI, bridge responses are also determined for the uniform ground motion and fixed base cases. This study proposing a compatible analytical model concerns the relative importance of the SSI and SVEGM and shows that these effects cannot be neglected in seismic analysis and design of long bridges.",

    "abstract": "A procedure for nonlinear analysis of RC slabs and shell structures is presented. Cracked RC is treated as an orthotropic material governed by a smeared rotating crack procedure and the constitutive formulations of the disturbed stress field model. The analysis procedure is implemented within the framework of a finite-element program employing layered thick-shell elements that consider out-of-plane (throughthickness) shear deformations. A simple modification method employing an effective shear strain concept is introduced to improve the out-of-plane performance of the layered shell element for RC applications. The adequacy of the procedure is verified using test data of RC members controlled by out-of-plane shear failure mechanisms and elements under combined in-plane and out-of-plane loading scenarios. The nonlinear finite-element program is shown to be suitable for elements exhibiting ductile or brittle responses, and the shear modification method introduced is found to be capable of capturing out-of-plane shear failures.

    "abstract": "Shear deformable beams have been widely used in engineering applications. Based on the matrix structural analysis (MSA), this paper presents a method for the buckling and second-order solutions of shear deformable beams, which allows the use of one element per member for the exact solution. To develop the second-order MSA method, this paper develops the element stability stiffness matrix of axial-loaded Timoshenko beam–columns, which relates the element-end deformations (translation and rotation angle) and corresponding forces (shear force and bending moment). First, an equilibrium analysis of an axial-loaded Timoshenko beam–column is conducted, and the element flexural deformations and forces are solved exactly from the governing differential equation. The element stability stiffness matrix is derived with a focus on the element-end deformations and the corresponding forces. Then, a matrix structural analysis approach for the elastic buckling analysis of Timoshenko beam–columns is established and demonstrated using classical application examples. Discussions on the errors of a previous simplified expression of the stability stiffness matrix is presented by comparing with the derived exact expression. In addition, the asymptotic behavior of the stability stiffness matrix to the first-order stiffness matrix is noted.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a probability model-based global sensitivity analysis (PM-GSA) framework, to compute various Sobol’ indices when only input-output data are available. The PM-GSA framework consists of two main elements, namely data extraction and probability model training. The data extraction step extracts data of the variables of interest (VoI) and quantity of interest (QoI) from an input-output data matrix. Following that, a probability model is built to approximate the joint probability density function between the VoI and QoI. The learned probability model is then used to compute various Sobol’ indices. The implementation of the PM-GSA framework is investigated through three probability models including Gaussian copula model, Gaussian mixture model, and a new Gaussian mixture copula model. The number of dimensions of the probability model in the PM-GSA framework, is independent of the number of input variables and is always N + 1 (e.g. 2 for the firstorder index), where N is the order of the Sobol’ index. In addition, the PM-GSA framework is applicable to global sensitivity analysis with not only independent input variables, but also with dependent input variables and for sets of variables. Four numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the different probability models.",

Specifically, a new topology optimization formulation is presented that accounts for the manufacturing constraints of uniform cross section and average member length. In addition, a new robotic assembly planning framework is demonstrated, which allows the complex but structurally efficient results of the topology optimization to be materialized in a reasonable amount of time. Three novel case studies produced by the proposed topology optimization framework are presented to demonstrate how automated assembly planning and robotic extrusion can enable a direct and efficient means to materialize a 3D topologyoptimized truss.",

Ideally, an algorithm should possess asymptoticannihilationof the highfrequency response,i.e. spuriousoscillations are eliminated after one time step.Numerous one-step algorithms,spectrally equivalent to linear multistep (LMS) methods, have been developed which include controllednumerical dissipation.This paper proves that the only unconditionally stable, second-order accurate, 3-step LMS method possessing asymptotic annihilationis Houbolt’s method, which is known to be overly dissipative in the low-frequency regime. Thus, using LMS methods, obtaining asymptoticannihilation with little low-frequency dissipation requires at least a 4-step method.",

    "abstract": "The buckling and postbuckling of beams is revisited taking into account both the influence of axial compressibility and shear deformation. A theory based on Reissner’s geometrically exact relations for the plane deformation of beams is adopted, in which the stress resultants depend linearly on the generalized strain measures. The equilibrium equation is derived in a general form that holds for the statically determinate and indeterminate combinations of boundary conditions representing the four fundamental buckling cases. The eigenvalue problem is recovered by consistent linearization of the governing equations, the critical loads at which the trivial solution bifurcates are determined, and the influence of shear on the buckling behavior is investigated. By a series of transformations, the equilibrium equation is rearranged such that it allows a representation of the solution in terms of elliptic integrals. Additionally, closed-form relations are provided for the displacement of the axis, from which buckled shapes are eventually obtained. Even for slender beams, for which shear deformation can usually be neglected, both the buckling and the postbuckling behavior turn out to be affected by shear not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the description, calibration and application of relatively simple hysteretic models that include strength and sti ness deterioration properties, features that are critical for demand predictions as a structural system approaches collapse. Three of the basic hysteretic models used in seismic demand evaluation are modiÿed to include deterioration properties: bilinear, peak-oriented, and pinching. The modiÿed models include most of the sources of deterioration: i.e. various modes of cyclic deterioration and softening of the post-yielding sti ness, and also account for a residual strength after deterioration. The models incorporate an energy-based deterioration parameter that controls four cyclic deterioration modes: basic strength, post-capping strength, unloading sti ness, and accelerated reloading sti ness deterioration. Calibration of the hysteretic models on steel, plywood, and reinforced-concrete components demonstrates that the proposed models are capable of simulating the main characteristics that in uence deterioration. An application of a peak-oriented deterioration model in the seismic evaluation of single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems is illustrated. The advantages of using deteriorating hysteretic models for obtaining the response of highly inelastic systems are discussed. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "In this work we present the implementation details of a quadratically converging, Newton-method-based algorithm for direct computation of instability points for 3d structures undergoing ®nite rotations. The structural model chosen for illustration is the 3d geometrically exact beam. The proposed algorithm makes use of an extended system, where equilibrium equations are supplemented with the loss-of-stability condition which roughly doubles the total number of equations. Nonetheless, the latter requires only an insigni®cant increase in computational cost due to judicious use of the bordering algorithm for computing the solution. The main thrust of our work is directed towards a careful development of linearized forms of the governing equations employed by Newton’s method. The corresponding results are presented both in material and spatial versions. A set of numerical examples is used to illustrate a very satisfying performance of the proposed algorithm.

    "abstract": "Real and complex Ritz vector bases for dynamic analysis of large linear systems with non-proportional damping are presented and compared. Both vector bases are generated utilizing load dependent vector algorithms that employ recurrence equations analogous to the Lanczos algorithm. The choice of static response to fixed spatial loading distribution, as a starting vector in recurrence equations, is motivated by the static correction concept. Different phases of dynamic response analysis are compared with respect to computational efficiency and accuracy. It is concluded that the real vector basis approach is approximately eight times more efficient than the complex vector basis approach. The complex vector basis has some advantages with respect to accuracy, if the excitation is of piecewise linear form, since the exact solution can be utilized. In addition, it is demonstrated that both Ritz vector bases, real and complex, possess superior accuracy over the adequate eigenvector bases.",

    "abstract": "In this work we present the implementation details of a quadratically converging, Newton-method-based algorithm for direct computation of instability points for 3d structures undergoing ®nite rotations. The structural model chosen for illustration is the 3d geometrically exact beam. The proposed algorithm makes use of an extended system, where equilibrium equations are supplemented with the loss-of-stability condition which roughly doubles the total number of equations. Nonetheless, the latter requires only an insigni®cant increase in computational cost due to judicious use of the bordering algorithm for computing the solution. The main thrust of our work is directed towards a careful development of linearized forms of the governing equations employed by Newton’s method. The corresponding results are presented both in material and spatial versions. A set of numerical examples is used to illustrate a very satisfying performance of the proposed algorithm.

A special attention is given to clarifying the issues pertaining to the finite element implementation which guarantees that the invariance of the continuum problem is preserved by its discrete approximation. Several numerical simulations dealing with finite rotations of structural models are presented in order to further illustrate and confirm the given theoretical considerations.",

Two different approaches to handle constraints, one based on the Lagrange multiplier procedure and another based on the use of release degrees of freedom, are examined in detail. The energy conserving time stepping scheme, which is proved to be well suited for integrating stiff differential equations, gouverning the motion of a single flexible link is appropriately modified and extended to nonlinear dynamics of multibody systems.",

    "abstract": "Many differential equations of practical interest evolve on Lie groups or on manifolds acted upon by Lie groups. The retention of Lie-group structure under discretization is often vital in the recovery of qualitatively correct geometry and dynamics and in the minimization of numerical error. Having introduced requisite elements of differential geometry, this paper surveys the novel theory of numerical integrators that respect Lie-group structure, highlighting theory, algorithmic issues and a number of applications.",

    "abstract": "Structural systems often show nonlinear behavior under severe excitations generated by natural hazards. In that condition, the restoring force becomes highly nonlinear showing significant hysteresis. The hereditary nature of this nonlinear restoring force indicates that the force cannot be described as a function of the instantaneous displacement and velocity. Accordingly, many hysteretic restoring force models were developed to include the time dependent nature using a set of differential equations. This survey contains a review of the past, recent developments and implementations of the Bouc-Wen model which is used extensively in modeling the hysteresis phenomenon in the dynamically excited nonlinear structures.",

    "abstract": "An investigation was conducted to study the behavior of plain concrete and steel fiber reinforced concrete under direct tension fatigue loading. Tests were conducted on dogbone specimens with varying amounts of steel fiber volume content (0, 0.75, and 1.5%). A new concept was introduced in deriving material damage parameters for plain and steel fiber concrete. The parameters developed were implemented into a damage evolution function to enable the prediction of concrete strength and fatigue secant modulus deterioration of steel fiber reinforced concrete. As such, the damage evolution models developed for steel fiber concrete can be implemented into steel fiber reinforced concrete constitutive models for the analysis of fatigue-damaged concrete elements. From the experimental results, the deformation profiles for plain and steel fiber concrete were similar, and the well-known relationship between the fatigue life and secondary strain rate of concrete in compression also exist for plain concrete and steel fiber concrete in tension. In addition, under the same loading parameters, the fatigue life of steel fiber concrete was found to increase as steel fiber content increased from 0 to 1.5%.

    "abstract": "Concrete elements deteriorate as a result of continuous application of compressive fatigue loads. Irreversible deformation accumulates; hence, the effect on embedded steel reinforcing bars capacity and concrete resistance should be accounted for in the fatigue analysis of concrete structures. Experimental investigations were conducted to study the fatigue behaviour of eight small-scale reinforced concrete deep beams with a shear span to effective depth ratio of 1.25. Percentages of the diagonal cracking load from monotonic tests were used as fatigue loads. The deformation evolution within the shear spans of the deep beams were obtained by estimating the average principal and shear strain evolutions from the strain transformation analysis of LVDT (Linear Variable Displacement Transformer) data. Midspan deflections and reinforcement strain evolutions with proximity to a major concrete crack location were obtained. In all beams, failure occurred with fracture of the longitudinal reinforcement at the intersection with the major concrete crack. Maximum strain evolutions for shear reinforcement measured at regions around the bends were observed to be lower than the strain evolutions observed in the longitudinal reinforcement. This was attributed to the governing arch mechanism common with deep beams.",

    "abstract": "In the literature, three basic assumptions are used to modify monotonic constitutive models in order to simplify fatigue analysis of concrete. First, the fatigue hysteresis loop at failure is assumed to intersect the monotonic stress–strain envelope. Second, it is assumed that the peak stress of a fatigue-damaged concrete element intersects the monotonic stress–strain envelope. Third, the centerlines of fatigue hysteresis loops are assumed to converge at a common point. Although the modifications supposedly lead to improved predictions, experimental verifications of these assumptions are currently insufficient to justify their implementation in the fatigue analysis of complex and large concrete structures where considerations of safety and cost-effectiveness are expedient. From experimental verifications conducted to ascertain the conservative level of these assumptions, it was found that the first and second assumptions seem reasonable, while the third assumption was inaccurate and thus in need of improvement. As such, a new convergence point is proposed. The constitutive models for high-strength and normal-strength concrete in compression were also modified as functions of the irreversible strain and residual strength. Further, a model was proposed for the irreversible strain accumulation, and its corroboration with experimental results showed good agreement.

    "abstract": "The implementation of fatigue-damage models into the governing equations of the disturbed stress field model algorithm for fatigue analysis of reinforced concrete structures is presented in this paper. The models account for concrete deterioration, localized reinforcement crack growth, and accumulation of irreversible compressive strain in conventional reinforced concrete and steel-fiber reinforced concrete due to fatigue loading. As such, analyses involving fatigue damage can be expressed in terms of the deformation evolution and residual capacity. These concepts overcome the well-known limitations of stress-life models for fatigue analysis of reinforced concrete structures. The implementation concepts using robust models from the literature are described. As a means of further illustration, the solutions to the deformation of a shear element under pure shear fatigue loading are presented. The validation of the modified algorithm using finiteelement analysis with experimental results for fatigue life and residual strength prediction gave good correlation.

The corotational formulation has often been introduced with a small strain assumption from the outset. A fundamental question, therefore, has been raised as to whether or not the numerical solutions obtained approach the solutions of a theory of finite strains with finite displacements. On the basis of the method proposed herein, a theoretical study for convergence of numerical solutions is made by comparing the approximated strains in the locally convected coordinates with the exact ones in the fixed global coordinates. Then the effects of locally convected coordinates on the accuracy of numerical solutions are discussed. Numerical examples are demonstrated to show the validity of the present theoretical results.",

The co-rotational formulation has often been used with an assumption that the relative deformations are small. A fundamental question, therefore, has been raised as to whether or not the numerical solutions obtained approach the solutions of the exact theory. In this paper, from theoretical point of view, we investigate the accuracy of the co-rotational formulation for 3-D Timoshenko’s beam undergoing finite strains and finite rotations. It is shown that the use of the conventional secant coordinates fails to give satisfactory numerical solutions. We introduce a new local coordinate system in which a linear beam theory is used to construct the strain energy function. It is shown that the finite element solutions obtained converge to those of the exact beam theory as the number of element increases.",

Three code-conforming special SMRFs, varying in height, were designed and were modeled using fully nonlinear assumptions and incorporating the connection model calibrated in the previous step. Subsequently, more than 1500 Nonlinear Dynamic Analyses (NDAs) were performed within the Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) procedure and were used as input to the Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) methodology. The structures performance was then quantitatively assessed in terms of Limit State (LS) frequency and “‘seismic demand hazard curves’”. The effect of neglecting some level of accuracy in the structural modeling process on the predicted performances was also assessed disregarding calibrated connection behavior and employing two alternate sets of building representatives. The performances predicted by inaccurate conventional models, through about 3500 additional NDAs, were then assessed qualitatively, and the significance of incorporating accurate structural models in the performance evaluation process was highlighted with reference to the obtained comparative results.",

    "abstract": "During the structural analysis of cable-stayed bridges, some specific problems arise that are not common in other types of bridges. One of these problem is the derivation of an optimal sequence for the tensioning of the stay cables. This paper describes a novel solution to this problem, the unit force method. The method takes into account all relevant effects for the design of cable-stayed bridges, including construction sequence, second-order theory, large displacements, cable sag and time-dependent effects, such as creep and shrinkage or relaxation of prestressing tendons. Information about the implementation of this method into a computer program is given, and an example of a practical application of this method concludes this paper. The method is not restricted to the design of cable-stayed bridges and may well be used for other structural applications in the future.",

    "abstract": "In the dynamic analysis of structural engineering systems, it is common practice to introduce damping models to reproduce experimentally observed features. These models, for instance Rayleigh damping, account for the damping sources in the system altogether and often lack physical basis. We report on an alternative path for reproducing damping coming from material nonlinear response through the consideration of the heterogeneous character of material mechanical properties. The parameterization of that heterogeneity is performed through a stochastic model. It is shown that such a variability creates the patterns in the concrete cyclic response that are classically regarded as source of damping.",

    "abstract": "The formulation of dynamic procedures for three-dimensional (3-D) beams requires extensive use of the algebra pertaining to the non-linear character of the rotation group in space. The corresponding extraction procedure to obtain the rotations that span a time step has certain limitations, which can have a detrimental e ect on the overall stability of a time-integration scheme. The paper describes two algorithms for the dynamics of 3-D beams, which di er in their manifestation of the above limitation. The ÿrst has already been described in the literature and involves the interpolation of iterative rotations, while an alternative formulation, which eliminates the above e ect by design, requires interpolation of incremental rotations. Theoretical arguments are backed by numerical results. Similarities between the conventional and new formulation are pointed out and are shown to be big enough to enable easy transformation of the conventional formulation into the new one. ? 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

It has recently become apparent that the important requirement of objectivity of adopted strain measures, although provided by the theory itself, does not automatically extend to a finite element formulation. In this paper we present a new finite element formulation of the geometrically exact 3D beam theory, specifically designed to preserve the objectivity of the adopted strain measures. In order to do so the current local rotations are interpolated in a manner similar to that adopted in co-rotational approaclies. However, no approximations typical for co-rotational approaches are introduced into the procedure, so in contrast to co-rotational formulations, the present formulation fully preserves the geometric exactness of the theory. A range of numerical examples serves to illustrate the problem and to assess the formulation. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "Real-time applications based on the principle of Dynamic Substructuring require integration methods that can deal with constraints without exceeding an a priori fixed number of steps. For these applications, first we introduce novel partitioned algorithms able to solve DAEs arising from transient structural dynamics. In particular, the spatial domain is partitioned into a set of disconnected subdomains and continuity conditions of acceleration at the interface are modeled using a dual Schur formulation. Interface equations along with subdomain equations lead to a system of DAEs for which both staggered and parallel procedures are developed. Moreover under the framework of projection methods, also a parallel partitioned method is conceived. The proposed partitioned algorithms enable a Rosenbrock-based linearly implicit LSRT2 method, to be strongly coupled with different time steps in each subdomain. Thus, user-defined algorithmic damping and subcycling strategies are allowed. Secondly, the paper presents the convergence analysis of the novel schemes for linear single-Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) systems. The algorithms are generally A-stable and preserve the accuracy order as the original monolithic method. Successively, these results are validated via simulations on single- and three-DoFs systems. Finally, the insight gained from previous analyses is confirmed by means of numerical experiments on a coupled spring–pendulum system. Copyright ᭧ 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arising from transient structural dynamics very often exhibit high-frequency/low-frequency and linear/nonlinear behaviors of subsets of the state variables. With this in mind, the paper resorts to the use of different time integrators with different time steps for subsystems, which tailors each method and its time step to the solution behaviors of the corresponding subsystem. In detail, a partitioned integration method is introduced which imposes continuity of velocities at the interface to couple arbitrary Newmark schemes with different time steps in different subdomains. It is proved that the velocity continuity of the method is the primal factor of its reduction to first-order accuracy. To maintain second-order accuracy without increasing drift and computational cost, a novel method with the acceleration continuity is proposed whose velocity constraint is also ensured by means of the projection strategy. Both its stability and accuracy properties are examined through numerical analysis of a Single-degree-of-freedom (DoF) split mass system. Finally, numerical validations are conducted on Single- and Two-DoF split mass systems and a four-DoF nonlinear structure showing the feasibility of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The ability to model inelastic deformation is of practical interest in many design applications, with the current emphasis on lighter weight structures and components. Incremental plasticity algorithms are often employed to model the plastic deformation. Some of the questions raised with both theoretical and engineering ramifications include, how are the material constants del:ermined and how sensitive is the model to the choice of the constants? The characteristics of a category of Armstrong-Frederick hardening rules are examined, invoking both theoretical and experimental considerations. Depending on the complexity of the model, phenomena such as ralchetting rate decay can be modeled with these algorithms. The model is shown to be insensitive to the yield stress chosen. Numerical extrapolation of the cyclic stress-strain curve is shown to eni~ance modeling without any penalty. The additional material constants employed to model ratchetting have a minimal influence on either proportional or nonproportional balanced loadings, he:ace these terms can be considered to be decoupled. Behavior of the predicted deformation becomes asymptotic for all loadings investigated with approximately ten terms in the backstress expansion. All these factors indicate the engineering potential of the Armstrong-Frederick type models, which include the Chaboche and Ohno-Wang enhancements. Furthermore, the basic structure of the model is amenable to incorporation of other material behaviors such as nonMasing, cyclic hardening or softening, and nonproportional hardening.",

The ERA minimum order realization approach using singular value decomposition is combined with the philosophy of the Correlation Fit method in state space form such that response data correlations rather than actual response values are used for modal parameter identification. This new method, the ERA using Data Correlations (ERA/DC), reduces bias errors due to noise corruption significantly without the need of model overspecification. This method is tested using simulated five-degree-of-freedom system responses corrupted by measurement noise. It is found for this case that, when model overspecification is permitted and a minimum order solution obtained via singular value truncation, the results from the two methods are of similar quality.",

    "abstract": "The problem of long time strength (evaluation of time to rupture) is of obvious relevance for various machine parts working under high temperature conditions. The existing data on specimens tested under uniaxial tension are insufficient for general loading conditions and inhomogeneous stress states: intensive experimental investigations are being conducted in this direction. Theoretical modelling of long time strength in the framework of continuum mechanics appears to be important. In recently published work of Hoff (1953), the moment of failure of a rod under tension is defined as the one at which the cross-sectional area becomes zero as a result of quasiviscous flow. His result is in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. A similar concept was used by Katz (1957) and by Rosenblum (1957) in their studies of times to rupture of thick-walled pipes and of a rotating disk with a hole. We note, however, that the experimental data points typically lie below the theoretical predictions and that rupture occurs at elongations not exceeding several tens per cent. The concept of Hoff has certain limitations. It predicts, for example, that creep under torsion does not result in rupture, contrary to observations. Also, his scheme does not explain fractures at small strains (“brittle” ruptures) and the change of character of rupture (from “viscous” to “brittle”) if the material is not sufficiently stable. Here, we suggest a theoretical model for the time to rupture with the account of embrittlement. We emphasize that the physics of such phenomena is very complex and has not been studied sufficiently. Although we discuss microcracking, the results can be interpreted in a more general way, in terms of development of damage.",

Since then, this estimation has been reported as being consistently lower than results obtained from experimental data. An assumption used by the original model is shown to be the cause of this underestimation. Identifying that the rocking takes place over a contact region, this study introduces a modified formulation for free rocking bodies and proposes an improved COR estimation to accurately quantify the energy dissipation of these structures. Using experimental data, it is shown that the improved CORs consistently provide better correlation to those established from tests than the COR obtained from the original approach.

Previous research has routinely described the dynamic behavior of these members using a coefficient of restitution ( r) modeling approach, which is shown in this paper to be insufficient for accurately capturing their decaying motion characteristics. Utilizing experimental testing and analytical investigation of concrete members, this study concludes that free-standing members dissipate energy in both a continuous manner and instantaneously at impacts at the rocking interface. Accounting for these two energy dissipation components is necessary to accurately produce rocking dynamic responses of free-standing blocks.",

    "abstract": "A unifying mathematical formulation is needed to move from one-off digital twins built through custom implementations to robust digital twin implementations at scale. This work proposes a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical representation of a digital twin and its associated physical asset. We create an abstraction of the asset-twin system as a set of coupled dynamical systems, evolving over time through their respective state-spaces and interacting via observed data and control inputs. The formal definition of this coupled system as a probabilistic graphical model enables us to draw upon well-established theory and methods from Bayesian statistics, dynamical systems, and control theory. The declarative and general nature of the proposed digital twin model make it rigorous yet flexible, enabling its application at scale in a diverse range of application areas. We demonstrate how the model is instantiated to enable a structural digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The digital twin is calibrated using experimental data from a physical UAV asset. Its use in dynamic decision making is then illustrated in a synthetic example where the UAV undergoes an in-flight damage event and the digital twin is dynamically updated using sensor data. The graphical model foundation ensures that the digital twin calibration and updating process is principled, unified, and able to scale to an entire fleet of digital twins.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear analysis of structures has become increasingly important in the study of structural response to hazardous loads such as earthquake and blast. Currently available tools for such analysis are research programs lacking convenient user-interfaces, or are general purpose Finite Element programs that require very fine-grained modeling that is often impractical to the engineer. This paper describes the outcome of a collaborative effort between the University at Buffalo and Larsa, Inc. in developing a user-friendly environment for such analyses, aimed at overcoming the above-mentioned shortcomings. The environment provides the ability to perform modeling at the necessary level, yet not requiring the engineer to have to deal with the fine-grained details. Both theoretical and implementation aspects are discussed. Firstly inelastic material models as well as uni-axial and coupled \"spring\" elements based on these models and the user-interfaces related to them are discussed. Next, two inelastic beam-column elements, one with concentrated uncoupled flexural plasticity and the other with distributed plasticity with three-dimensional interaction are described along with the various numerical as well graphical outputs representing to the inelastic response of such elements. Nonlinear static as well as dynamic analysis procedures utilizing automatic step size control algorithms are discussed next. Analysis features are described for the equivalent static procedure (pushover analysis) used in seismic design and in the load redistribution analysis under element loss such as under blast loading. Since both these load conditions involve constant load profiles with only a scalar parameter, an automatic stepping algorithm combined with an arc-length control strategy is utilized. Several illustrative examples of all these features are presented.",

FRP composites are used for strengthening applications mainly due to the lightweight, high compressive strength, resistance to corrosion, speed and ease of application and formed on site. Conceptually, the stress strain relation of concrete as a nonhomogenous and nonlinear composite material is not unique that depends on the many variables. In this study some common mathematical models for concrete in the stress-strain relation have been discussed to clarify mechanical behavior of concrete up to ultimate strain. However models of concrete confined by fiber composites corresponding to Stress -Strain relations of TDY2007 and ACI 2002 codes were compared for strengthening concrete sections. Furthermore it is noted that using FRP material increases both strength and ductility of compressive sections.",

    "abstract": "The continuing development of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard by the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI) creates new possibilities for achieving interoperability for design software through the use of a common object model of the building and its open data transfer standard. Several architectural CAD tools are already IFC-compliant. However, in-depth knowledge of the highly complex IFC object model is required to develop IFC-compliant software. It has proven quite dif®cult to read the huge amount of building data stored in an IFC ®le, extract the information needed by a particular application, and correctly update the IFC ®le with new data. To make this work easier for developers not familiar with the IFC, Olof Granlund Oy has developed a new development tool, BSPro COM-Server for IFC Files. Using this tool, a software developer of new or existing tools can achieve IFC compatibility with a quite reasonable amount of work.",

In this paper a modified version of CBO, denoted by MCBO, is utilized to optimize the cost of bridge superstructures. The problem consists of 17 variables and 101 implicit constraints based on AASHTO standard specifications and construction limitations. The optimization is performed for bridges with different span lengths and deck widths, and with various unit costs of concrete. A comparison among the PSO, CBO, and MCBO algorithms is conducted which shows the efficiency and robustness of the MCBO algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The application of GFRP bars requires a familiar safety concept based on reliably determined long-term values. Therefore, the effect of different exposure conditions and their synergism on mechanical and durability properties needs to be considered. This paper presents experimental and analytical investigations about the permanent tensile resistance of GFRP bars in concrete environment. For comparison, specimens were exposed to alkaline environment and/or moisture at elevated stress levels to accelerate the effect of real life conditions. To predict the long-term behavior within reasonable test durations the timetemperature superposition principle was applied by obtaining creep curves at temperatures of 23°C (room temperature), 40°C and 60°C. The results indicated that the durability and damage mechanism of the bars were affected by alkalinity and moisture. As a conclusion, the interaction of the particular expositions seems to be significant and needs to be assessed.",

    "abstract": "The effects of the co-seismic static offset (known as fling step) and associated velocity pulses on civil structures have been difficult to study because the static offset is typically removed during the processing of earthquake ground motion records. Simulated ground motions contain fling features and require no processing; therefore, they create new opportunities for representing fling features in seismic hazard analysis and assessing their influence on the seismic demands on near-fault structures. We use physics-based fault rupture simulations to study the characteristics of ground motions with fling step and the sensitivity of the near-fault structural demands to strong fling features. We uncover that simulated ground motions with a large fling step tend to have higher spectral intensity than those without a fling step at the same rupture distance, especially at periods longer than 2 s. As a result, the structural demands on flexible buildings tend to be the most sensitive to the fling features. Statistical analysis suggests that the ground motion spectral shape (represented by spectral accelerations at multiple periods) is—in most cases—a sufficient predictor of the structural demands on near-fault low-rise and mid-rise buildings at locations that are susceptible to strong fling effects. Finally, ground motion record selection experiments reveal that representing the spectral shape features at periods that are most relevant to a given structure may be an effective strategy to reduce the bias in the estimated demands on near-fault long-period structures when the available database of records is considered deficient in fling features.",

    "abstract": "This thesis is concerned with the inelastic behaviour of reinforced concrete members subjected to cyclic over­load. Theoretical methods for predicting the flexural behaviour of reinforced concrete members have been advanced and compared with experimental evidence at each stage in the development. Particular attention has been paid to the influence of conventional rectangular binding steel on the stress-strain properties of concrete and the effect on ductility in reinforced concrete beams and columns. The Bauschinger Effect in cyclically-stressed structural grade reinforcing steel was studied in some detail, both experimentally and theoretically, and a mathematical model for this behaviour was derived and is incorporated in the analyses. Since cyclic loading predictions require the complete loading histories of the component materials to be known, and since both materials have complex responses to this type of load, all of the analyses have been programmed for computer use. A further experimental programme using cyclically­loaded beams was conducted in order to compare theoretical and experimental moment-curvature and load-deflection behavior. These beams were simply-supported and cyclically-loaded to simulate seismic response in beams at connections with columns. Close agreement between experiment and the proposed theories was found.",

    "abstract": "Recent catastrophic bridge failures clearly indicate the urgent need for improving interval-based bridge inspection procedures that are qualitative and subjective in nature. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) can mitigate the deficiencies of interval-based inspection techniques and provide real-time diagnostic information regarding the bridge structural health. SHM is not flawless however; the variability in the vehicle characteristics and traffic operational conditions makes it prone to false diagnosis. Recent advancements in the integration of SHM with intelligent transportation systems (ITS) demonstrate the successful use of ITS devices (e.g., traffic cameras, traffic detectors) in the analysis of bridge responses to multimodal traffic with varying loads or during the critical events that cause excess vibration beyond the normal limit. In an ITS-informed SHM system, the ITS device collected data can be integrated with SHM to increase the reliability and accuracy of the SHM system. This integration would reduce the possibility of false diagnosis of damages detected by the SHM system (e.g., vibrations caused by heavy vehicles on a bridge could be read by a SHM sensor as a structural health problem of the bridge), which would eventually decrease the bridge maintenance costs. Similarly, in SHM-informed ITS system, SHM sensors can provide data on bridge health condition for ITS applications, where ITS uses this bridge health condition information for realtime traffic management. In this paper, literature related to both ITS-informed SHM and SHM-informed ITS is reviewed. Based on the literature review, potential challenges and future research directions associated with ITS-SHM integration are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Computationally efficient macromodels are developed for investigating the progressive collapse resistance of seismically designed steel moment frame buildings. The developed models are calibrated using detailed finite-element models of beam-column subassemblages and account for the most important physical phenomena associated with progressive collapse. The models are utilized to compare the collapse resistance of two-dimensional, ten-story steel moment frames designed for moderate and high seismic risk according to current design specifications and practices. The simulation results show that the frame designed for high seismic risk has somewhat better resistance to progressive collapse than the system designed for moderate seismic risk. The better performance is attributed to layout and system strength rather than the influence of improved ductile detailing. The alternate path method is shown to be useful for judging the ability of a system to absorb the loss of a critical member. However, it is pointed out that the method does not provide information about the reserve capacity of the system and so its results should be carefully evaluated.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents partial results of an international collaborative project named “SEACON” that aims at demonstrating the safe and durable utilization of seawater and salt-contaminated aggregates (natural or recycled) for a sustainable concrete production when combined with noncorrosive reinforcement. Seawater and salt-contaminated aggregates use in reinforced concrete (RC) is currently prohibited by building codes due to corrosion of the steel reinforcement. In response to this challenge, concrete made with seawater and salt-contaminated aggregate is combined with noncorrosive reinforcement (i.e. Glass-Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer (GFRP) or stainless steel). The initial results presented herein evaluate the durability of GFRP bars embedded in concrete with no chloride limit. RC specimens were immersed in seawater at 60 °C as accelerated conditioning. The residual mechanical properties (i.e., tensile strength, chord modulus of elasticity, transverse and horizontal shear strength) of the embedded GFRP bars, compared to pristine companion samples tested prior to casting, were evaluated after one-year exposure to accelerated conditioning. The experimental results show that the performance of the GFRP bars embedded in concrete with no chloride limit exposed to accelerated conditioning for one year is at least comparable to pristine rebars.",

    "abstract": "For self-anchored suspension bridges, stiffening girders or trusses should be erected prior to the air-spinning of the main cables. Since hangers are installed between pre-constructed stiffening trusses and main cables, tensioning processes are necessary for hanger installation in the case of a self-anchored suspension bridge. Since hanger tension variations in construction are quite dependent on the constructional plan adopted, the jacking force and probable maximum tension should be predicted and compared in the constructional design state so as to determine the most feasible and effective plan among the possible options. This is generally done by the use of a so-called geometrically nonlinear construction step analysis. A finite element (FE) analysis procedure, which utilizes elastic catenary cable element formulation for controlling the length of the cable members, is proposed for the development of a hanger installation plan, in particular for the self-anchored Yongjong Bridge. As a pre-requisite to a rigorous backward/forward construction step analysis, an unbalanced load-free FE model was established following a nonlinear shape-finding analysis procedure. Based on a series of comparative studies, an installing plan, which utilizes the synchronized jacking of a maximum of 80 strand jacks with the combination of a divided tensioning technique, is proposed and its successful application to the construction of the Yongjong Bridge is described.",

Details are presented of the numerical techniques used to represent the RC frame, the FRP, and the bond properties between the FRP and the concrete. The FE analysis is performed using a two-dimensional nonlinear FE analysis program based on the disturbed stress field model. To augment verification studies undertaken with beam specimens previously tested, a large-scale RC frame with one-span and two-story height was constructed and tested under lateral load conditions. The frame was first heavily damaged in shear, repaired with FRP wrap, and then subjected to a regime of reversed cyclic loads. A detailed comparison is carried out between analytical and experimental results for the hysteretic response, damage mode, crack pattern, and deformation of the frame. It is concluded that reasonably accurate simulations of the behavior of FRP-repaired shear-critical structures can be achieved through finite-element modeling.",

From a phenomenological perspective, this study combined the Bouc-Wen models with piecewise linear functions that can capture the hysteretic behavior with asymmetric strength degradation.

    "abstract": "We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

    "abstract": "In this paper an interface is derived between arbitrary three-dimensional material laws and finite elements which include special stress conditions. The mechanical models of beams and shells are usually based upon zero-stress conditions. This requires a material law respecting the stress condition for each finite element formulation. Complicated materials, e.g. finite strain models are often described in the 3D-continuum. Considering the zero-stress condition requires a reformulation of these material laws, which is often complicated. The subject of this paper is to incorporate physically non-linear 3D-material laws in beam and shell elements. To this effect a local algorithm will be developed to condense an arbitrary 3D-material law with respect to the zero-stress condition. The algorithm satisfies the stress condition at each integration point on the element level.",

The log book of these errors, numbering more than 850 items, appears as an appendix to this paper. The errors have been classified into fifteen categories for purposes of analysis, and some of the noteworthy bugs are discussed in detail. The history of the TEX project can teach valuable lessons about the preparation of highly portable software and the maintenance of programs that aspire to high standards of reliability.",

    "abstract": "Block objects, standing on a shaking foundation, tend to rock and may uplift. Rocking of buildings in earthquakes is of particular interest because human lives and high costs are at stake. Most previous studies on rocking are limited to two‐dimensional motion for simplicity. In this paper, a new model is studied, which includes the three‐dimensional rocking, rolling, and uplift of a rigid cylinder when subjected to ground motion. The cylinder rests on a Winkler foundation of independent springs and dashpots. To simulate uplift, the springs and dashpots separate from the base of the cylinder when the springs are about to be in tension. The governing equations of this system are derived exactly using the Lagrange equation. Then numerical integration is employed to obtain the motion of any point within the structure, and simple beam theory is used to calculate the 3‐D state of stresses within the cylinder. Computer simulations show that 3‐D motion is significant under earthquake‐like excitations. Near‐2‐D rocking also occurs and produces very high spikes in accelerations and internal stresses. Moreover, restricting uplift can introduce high stresses and accelerations inside the structure.",

    "abstract": "The subject of so-called objective derivatives (in Continuum Mechanics) has a long history and is somehow controversial. Several works concern the formulation of the correct mathematical definition of what they are really and try to unify them all into one definition (or one family). In this paper, we show, finally, that all of them correspond in fact to covariant derivatives on the infinite dimensional manifold Met(B) of all Riemannian metrics on the body. Moreover, a natural Leibniz rule, which allows to define an objective derivative on contravariant tensor fields given one on covariant tensor fields and vice versa makes the distinction between those of them who are of “Lie type” or of “co-rotational type” useless. We calculate furthermore, for an exhaustive list of objective derivatives found in the literature, the corresponding covariant derivative on Met(B).",

We then recall the general approach of continuum damage based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes and its application to isotropic damage modelling. The study of damageinduced anisotropy is treated by considering a second order tensorial damage variable. Finally, we present an original macroscopic approach through which is addressed the question of unilateral effects due to the microcracks closure.",

The element consists of a linear elastic component with a plastic hinge at each end whose inelastic response is described by extending the concept of generalized plasticity to stress resultants. With independent yield and limit surfaces it is possible to describe the gradual yielding of composite sections and their post-yield hardening behavior. The geometric nonlinearity under large displacements is accounted for with the corotational formulation. The paper discusses the calibration of the model parameters and assesses the accuracy of the model through correlation studies.",

The smooth rate-independent model originally proposed by Bouc [1] and later extended by Wen [2] was further developed by Sivaselvan and Reinhorn [3] to incorporate degradation phenomena. This is extended herein to incorporate two specific modifications; one accounting for the loading history effect in stiffness degradation, pointed out by Wang and Foliente [4], and another related to compatibility with plasticity postulates. The latter is independently enforced based on the method developed by Charalampakis and Koumousis [5], eliminating the model’s displacement drift, force relaxation and non-closure of hysteretic loops when subjected to short unloading–reloading paths. Numerical examples are presented for a single-degree-of-freedom system demonstrating the effect of the modifications, particularly for seismic excitations.",

    "abstract": "The need for comparable loading histories for seismic acceptance testing is becoming more prevalent as (a) performance-based design, which requires quantification of performance, is becoming a more widely accepted alternative to routine code design, (b) more and more innovative performance enhancement systems (e.g., buckling restrained braces) hit the engineering market, and (c) globalization becomes a widely accepted concept that necessitates globally accepted performance standards. Present codes, standards, and guidelines make reference to the need for performance assessment through testing, but with few exceptions (e.g., AISC 341-05 and testing of base isolation systems in ASCE 7-05) they remain mostly silent on testing and acceptance criteria to be used for this purpose. This paper provides a summary of (a) the background behind several of the presently employed cyclic loading histories, (b) basic concepts that should be considered in the development of loading histories, and (c) recent developments that point towards the need for modifications or expansion of presently employed loading protocols.",

The shear flexibility relies on a decomposition of the shear stresses into torsion and shear contributions, and the normalized strain energy of the latter is expressed in terms of the shear flexibility tensor. An explicit approximation for the shear flexibility tensor is derived for cross sections of moderate wall thickness. A special Legendre transformation is used to obtain a consistent discretization, which is then cast in the form of a finite beam element. The accuracy of the method is illustrated by comparison with experimental results for a steam turbine blade, and the effects of pretwist and shear flexibility are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A procedure for efficient three-dimensional nonlinear time-history analysis of steel framed buildings is derived. It incorporates two types of nonlinear beam elements—the plastic hinge type and the elastofiber type—and nonlinear panel zone elements to model yielding and strain-hardening in moment-frames. Floors and roofs of buildings are modeled using 4-node elastic diaphragm elements. The procedure utilizes an iteration strategy applied to an implicit time-integration scheme to solve the nonlinear equations of motion at each time step. Geometric nonlinearity is included. An overview of the procedure and the theories for the panel zone and the plastic hinge elements are presented in this paper. The theory for the elastofiber element along with illustrative examples are presented in a companion paper. The plastic hinge beam element consists of two nodes at which biaxial flexural yielding is permitted, leading to the formation of plastic hinges. Elastic rotational springs are connected across the plastic hinge locations to model strain-hardening. Axial yielding is also permitted. The panel zone element consists of two orthogonal panels forming a cruciform section. Each panel may yield and strain-harden in shear.",

    "abstract": "We reformulate the midpoint Lie algorithm, which is implicit in the torque calculation, to achieve explicitness in the torque evaluation. This is effected by approximating the impulse imparted over the time step with discrete impulses delivered at either the beginning of the time step or at the end of the time step. Thus, we obtain two related variants, both of which are explicit in the torque calculation, but only first order in the time step. Both variants are momentum conserving and both are symplectic. Consequently, drawing on the properties of the composition of maps, we introduce another algorithm that combines the two variants in a single time step. The resulting algorithm is explicit, momentum conserving, symplectic, and second order. Its accuracy is outstanding and consistently outperforms currently known implicit and explicit integrators.

    "abstract": "A generalized formulation of the Energy-Momentum Methodwill be developed within the framework of the Generalized- Methodwhich allows at the same time guaranteed conservation or decay of total energy and controllable numerical dissipation of unwanted high frequency response. Furthermore, the latter algorithm will be extended by the consistently integrated constraints of energy and momentum conservation originally derived for the Constraint Energy-Momentum Algorithm. The goal of this general approach of implicit energyconserving and decaying time integration schemes is, to compare these algorithms on the basis of an equivalent notation by the means of an overall algorithmic design and hence to investigate their numerical properties. Numerical stability and controllable numerical dissipation of high frequencies will be studied in application to non-linear structural dynamics. Among the methods considered will be the Newmark Method, the classical -methods, the Energy-Momentum Methodwith and without numerical dissipation, the Constraint EnergyMomentum Algorithm and the Constraint Energy Method.

The Meloland Road Overcrossing Bridge, which is heavily instrumented, is selected as a reference analysis model due to the existence of measured data. The components as well as the integrated system are verified through comparison with previous studies and measured data. The stiffness of abutments and pile foundations are evaluated by three-dimensional finite-element analysis and compared with those from previous investigations. The analytical models of abutments and foundations are combined with the structural model using the multiplatform analysis framework, UI-SimCor. The dynamic properties of the model for multiplatform analysis are compared with those evaluated from system identification techniques using recorded ground motion. Finally, response history analyses are conducted with recorded free-field ground motion. The analysis results are in very good agreement with measured response showing the promising potential of multiplatform dynamic simulation.",

    "abstract": "This book treats computational modeling of structures in which strong nonlinearities are present. It is therefore a work in mechanics and engineering, although the discussion centers on methods of solution and approximation that are classically considered as parts of applied mathematics. The goal is to simulate numerically the behavior of a structure under various imposed excitations, forces, and displacements, and then to determine the resulting damage to the structure, and ultimately to optimize the structure to minimize the damage subject to various constraints. Practical applications of the methods include design and optimization of structures and analyses of their reliability. The method used is iterative: at each stage one computes an approximation to the displacements, strains, and stresses everywhere in the structure and for all times in the interval of interest. The method rests on some remarkable properties satisfied by most of the models encountered in structural mechanics, and it leads to a general approach for understanding structural models and the necessary approximations.",

    "abstract": "We describe LLVM (low level virtual machine), a compiler framework designed to support transparent, lifelong program analysis and transformation for arbitrary programs, by providing high-level information to compiler transformations at compile-time, link-time, run-time, and in idle time between runs. LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, a formulation is presented for the finite element treatment of multibody, large deformation frictional contact problems. The term multibody is used to mean that when two bodies mechanically contact, both may be deformable. A novel aspect of the approach advocated is that the equations governing contact are developed in the continuum setting first , before deriving the corresponding finite element equations This feature distinguishes the current work from many earlier treatments of contact problems and renders it considerably more general. In particular, the approach yields a characterization of the frictional constraint (assuming a Coulomb law) suitable for arbitrary discretizations in either two or three dimensions. A geometric framework is constructed within which both frictionless and frictional response are naturally described, making subsequent finite element discretization a straightforward substitution of finite‐dimensional solution spaces for their continuum counterparts. To our knowledge, this general formulation and implementation of the frictional contact problem in a finite element setting has not been reported previously in the literature. The development includes exact linearization of the statement of virtual work, which enables optimal convergence properties for Newton‐Raphson solution strategies, and which appears to be highly desirable (if not essential) for the general robustness of implicit finite element techniques. Since the theory and subsequent linearization require no limitations on the amount of deformation or relative sliding that can occur, the resulting treatment of frictional contact is suitable for a wide range of examples displaying significant non‐linear behaviour. This assertion is substantiated through presentation of a variety of examples in both two and three dimensions.",

    "abstract": "With traditional linear algebra texts, the course is relatively easy for students during the early stages as material is presented in a familiar, concrete setting. However, when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a wall. Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations) are not easily understood and require time to assimilate. These concepts are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, so students’ understanding of them is vital to mastering the subject. This text makes these concepts more accessible by introducing them early in a familiar, concrete Rn setting, developing them gradually, and returning to them throughout the text so that when they are discussed in the abstract, students are readily able to understand.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with Newmark time stepping methods and finite rotations for nonlinear finite element analysis of flexible beam structures. The corotational method is used to develop expressions of the internal forces and the corresponding tangent stiffness matrices. For the dynamic part, four formulations based on different parameterizations of rotations are compared. The first three are classic formulations taken from the literature with some modifications for two of them. The last one is new and uses three of the four Euler parameters (quaternion) as rotational variables. For all these approaches, theoretical derivations as well as practical implementations are given in detail. The similarities and differences between the formulations are pointed out. Six numerical examples are studied in order to compare these four formulations in terms of numerical accuracy and computational efficiency. Regarding efficiency, the choice of the predictor at each time step and the possibility to simplify the tangent inertia matrix are carefully investigated. The numerical results show that these four formulations have the same numerical accuracy, but that the computational efficiency depends on the choice of the tangent inertia matrix. Besides, the new formulation proposed in this paper turns out to be the fastest one.",

    "abstract": "Beam elements are commonly used in the analysis of steel and reinforced concrete structures in earthquake engineering practice. These elements reproduce the global behavior of these structures at a reasonable computational cost. For this type of analysis the force-based fiber beam element has proven an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational cost for the simulation of the inelastic response of structural models of significant size. Recent studies have proposed extensions of the model to account for the effect of shear and torsion under fixed shear strain or stress distributions. These assumptions suffer from shortcomings for the representation of the coupling between shear and torsion, and are not suitable for the representation of local stress and strain distributions at critical sections. To describe such complex stress states, shell finite element models are often used with a significant increase in computational cost. This paper presents the mixed formulation of an enhanced 3d fiber beam element that represents accurately the global and local response of structural members under axial force, flexure, shear and torsion interaction. The proposed 3d fiber beam element determines the shear strain distribution at a section from the satisfaction of local equilibrium equations with the section warping displacements as local parameters. Unlike existing models, the coupling between sections is taken in account. Hence the enhanced fiber beam-column is able to capture the local effects due to constrained warping of the section, such as the flange shear lag effect. The model is also capable of representing accurately the maximum local stress at element boundaries, and of simulating the torsional response of beams under warping constraints.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the effects of element distortions on the performance of displacement-based isoparametric quadrilateral finite elements. Suitable example problems for both the Lagrangian and the serendipity types of elements are used to show numerically the effects of element distortions. The effects of angular and curved-edge distortions are evaluated analytically in terms of the abilities of the elements to represent exactly various polynomial displacement fields. We then solve a plane stress problem adaptively to demonstrate the effect of element distortions on the accuracy of the stress distribution. The conclusion is that the Lagrangian elements are not affected by angular distortions and are therefore the more reliable elements for general use.",

    "abstract": "A new plastic-damage model for concrete subjected to cyclic loading is developed using the concepts of fracture-energy-based damage and stiffness degradation in continuum damage mechanics. Two damage variables, one for tensile damage and the other for compressive damage, and a yield function with multiple-hardening variables are introduced to account for different damage states. The uniaxial strength functions are factored into two parts, corresponding to the effective stress and the degradation of elastic stiffness. The constitutive relations for elastoplastic responses are decoupled from the degradation damage response, which provides advantages in the numerical implementation. In the present model, the strength function for the effective stress is used to control the evolution of the yield surface, so that calibration with experimental results is convenient. A simple and thermodynamically consistent scalar degradation model is introduced to simulate the effect of damage on elastic stiffness and its recovery during crack opening and closing. The performance of the plastic-damage model is demonstrated with several numerical examples of simulating monotonically and cyclically loaded concrete specimens.",

Three verification examples show the capability of the developed model in estimating the nonlinear structural behavior including softening. As an application of the developed computational model, a probabilistic strength analysis of a RC column is conducted in terms of the axial load–bending moment interaction.

    "abstract": "The uncertainty in the seismic demand of a structure (referred to as the engineering demand parameter, EDP) needs to be properly characterized in performance-based earthquake engineering. Uncertainties in the ground motion and in structural properties are responsible for EDP uncertainty. In this study, sensitivity of EDPs to major uncertain variables is investigated using the ÿrst-order second-moment method for a case study building. This method is shown to be simple and e cient for estimating the sensitivity of seismic demand. The EDP uncertainty induced by each uncertain variable is used to determine which variables are most signiÿcant. Results show that the uncertainties in ground motion are more signiÿcant for global EDPs, namely peak roof acceleration and displacement, and maximum inter-storey drift ratio, than those in structural properties. Uncertainty in the intensity measure (IM) of ground motion is the dominant variable for uncertainties in local EDPs such as the curvature demand at critical cross-sections. Conditional sensitivity of global and local EDPs given IM is also estimated. It is observed that the combined e ect of uncertainties in structural properties is more signiÿcant than uncertainty in ground motion proÿle at lower IM levels, while the opposite is true at higher IM levels.

    "abstract": "The paper presents a new beam-column element that combines computational efficiency with accuracy. The element uses only one monitoring section in each end inelastic zone of the structural member, but accounts for the spread of inelastic deformations under strain hardening response. It is, therefore, a variable inelastic zone model that combines the benefit of integrating the section momentcurvature response with the computational efficiency of concentrated hinge models for beams and columns. The element is more accurate than current distributed inelasticity models in simulating the monotonic and cyclic inelastic response of beams and columns under typical curvature distributions, while being much more cost effective. The element is also suitable for softening response, as long as a relation is available between the length of the softening zone and element response parameters.",

    "abstract": "Mixed formulations of frame elements offer significant advantages over more traditional displacement formulations, particularly under large cyclic inelastic deformations including the effects of shear. This paper complements the recent proposal of a consistent variational basis for the mixed formulation of frame elements by supplying the explicit definition of the stress field over the cross-section. The paper also addresses the numerical stability of the element state determination algorithm in the presence of an ill-conditioned or even singular section stiffness matrix. The proposed algorithm is based on the eigendecomposition of the section stiffness matrix and uses the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula and the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse to avoid the inversion of ill-conditioned matrices in the element state determination. In the extreme case of uniform tension or uniform flexure the section flexibility matrix is split into an elastic and a plastic component before eigendecomposition. With the proposed method the inelastic response of the element under multiple perfectly plastic hinges can be successfully traced. Numerical examples demonstrate the capabilities of the approach.

To this end, the load-resisting mechanism of the column-removed double-span beams was investigated based on the material and geometric nonlinear parametric finite-element analysis. A multilinear parallel point hinge model which captures the moment-axial tension interaction was then proposed. The emphasis was to develop a reliable and computationally efficient macromodel for practical progressive collapse analysis. The application of the proposed hinge model to nonlinear dynamic progressive collapse analysis was illustrated by using OpenSEES program. The accuracy as well as the efficiency of the proposed model was verified based on inelastic dynamic finite-element analysis results. The importance of including catenary action effects for proper progressive collapse resistant analysis and design was also emphasized.",

    "abstract": "A tension stiffening model is presented which enables the calculation of average tensile stresses in concrete, after yielding of reinforcement, in reinforced concrete elements subjected to uniaxial tension, shear or flexure. To determine the average tensile stress–strain relationship for concrete, a crack analysis approach is employed taking into account the bond mechanism between concrete and deformed reinforcing bars, and numerical analyses are conducted to determine the tensile behavior of reinforced concrete members including post-yield response. Analytical parametric studies are conducted to determine the influence of various parameters including concrete compressive strength and reinforcement yield strength, ultimate strength, hardening stress, and hardening strain. Analysis results obtained from the proposed model, when compared to experimental results for uniaxial members, indicate good agreement for structural behavior after yielding of reinforcement. The proposed model makes it possible to accurately calculate reinforcement stresses at crack locations and, thus, average strain conditions which result in rupture of reinforcement. This leads to more realistic predictions of the uniaxial, flexural, and shear ductility of reinforced concrete members.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a composite frame element for the simulation of the inelastic response of structural members made up of two or more components with different materials, such as reinforced concrete (RC), steel-concrete composite members, prestressed members, and members with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement. The element accounts for the relative slip at the interface between the components. Nonlinear geometry effects are accounted for through the corotational formulation, which permits the response simulation of composite frame elements under large displacements. The element formulation enhances the standard Hu-Washizu variational principle with fields describing the bond-slip behavior between components. Three alternatives for the mixed formulation of the element are derived in this paper, which focuses on theory and implementation: mixed-displacement, mixed-force, and mixed-mixed. The paper presents the benefits and shortcomings of the formulation alternatives for modeling the pullout failure of reinforcing bars and the fixed-end rotation of RC members and discusses the numerical ramifications of each alternative. A companion paper discusses the convergence performance of the different mixed formulations and validates the proposed element through correlation studies with available experimental results.

    "abstract": "Structural analysis of frames is generally based on centreline-to-ccntreline geometry. However, in many structures, member dimensions might be quite large and have a significant effect on frame lateral stiffness. Rigid offsets extending from the joint centrelines to the faces of the members are used to model the rigid rotation kinematic of finite joint area. This approach can underestimate drifts of structures since it neglects elastic deformations of the joint regions. In this paper, a joint element is used to consider the rigid kinematic motion, elastic shear, and bending deformations of beam-column panel zone regions. Parametric analyses have been carried out on the seismic response of a ten-storey steel frame to determine the impact of panel zone deformations on the structure’s elastic response. It is shown that kinematic effects and panel zone shear deformations are best modelled using rigid zone reduction factors to define rigid offset effective lengths. On the other hand, the consideration of panel zone bending deformations resulted in drifts values that were significantly larger than the usual rigid point joint assumption.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear problems are prevalent in structural and continuum mechanics, and there is high demand for computational tools to solve these problems. Despite efforts to develop efficient and effective algorithms, one single algorithm may not be capable of solving any and all nonlinear problems. A brief review of recent nonlinear solution techniques is first presented. Emphasis, however, is placed on the review of load, displacement, arc length, work, generalized displacement, and orthogonal residual control algorithms, which are unified into a single framework. Each of these solution schemes differs in the use of a constraint equation for the incremental-iterative procedure. The governing finite element equations and constraint equation for each solution scheme are combined into a single matrix equation, which characterizes the unified approach. This conceptual model leads naturally to an effective object-oriented implementation. Within the unified framework, the strengths and weaknesses of the various solution schemes are examined through numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "This report traces the history of the elastica from its first precise formulation by James Bernoulli in 1691 through the present. The complete solution is most commonly attributed to Euler in 1744 because of his compelling mathematical treatment and illustrations, but in fact James Bernoulli had arrived at the correct equation a half-century earlier. The elastica can be understood from a number of different aspects, including as a mechanical equilibrium, a problem of the calculus of variations, and the solution to elliptic integrals. In addition, it has a number of analogies with physical systems, including a sheet holding a volume of water, the surface of a capillary, and the motion of a simple pendulum. It is also the mathematical model of the mechanical spline, used for shipbuilding and similar applications, and directly insipired the modern theory of mathematical splines. More recently, the major focus has been on efficient numerical techniques for computing the elastica and fitting it to spline problems. All in all, it is a beautiful family of curves based on beautiful mathematics and a rich and fascinating history.",

    "abstract": "A simplified method for finding rotational boundary stiffnesses, representing the foundations of a structure and its surrounding soil, is developed. This technique is applied to the Meloland Road overpass, for which records were obtained during the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake. A system identification method was previously used to find the predominant modes of the structure. A very simple, finite element 3-D beam model for the bridge is constructed, and the rotational stiffnesses are used to model the effect of the foundations. A dynamic analysis is performed, in which the recorded translational earthquake accelerations are used as input excitation to the structure, and the predominant modal frequencies of the model are shown to compare well with the results obtained through system identification, even though simplifying assumptions were made. A sensitivity analysis is also performed on the rotational boundary springs to study how much they affect the dynamic response of the structure. In further studies, these procedures could be used to gain more insight into the dynamic effects of soil-structure interaction and should prove to be particularly useful for preliminary designs of structures.",

The finite-element formulation is based on the concept of kinematic group, which is a geometrical object comprising two nodes on the rod axis and two adjoined vectors (directors) which define orientation of the cross section at each node. Results of sample problems are given to show the applicability of the element to study nonlinear deformation and stability of three-dimensional elastic rods undergoing finite rotations.",

    "abstract": "The analytical solution for the large deformation of a cantilever beam under a point load, typically applied to the tip of the cantilever and perpendicularly to its axis, has been widely studied and published. However, the more complex case of two angled point loads applied to the cantilever has not been published. The current research delved into the following scenario: an upright cantilever, e.g. a pole, has point loads applied at two locations on the cantilever, where each point load is angled, i.e. the point load has both a horizontal component (which may result from wind loading) and downward vertical component of force (such as from weights). The aim of the research is to develop a methodology for finding, at the two locations where the point loads are applied, the angle of deflection, the horizontal deflection, and the vertically deflected height. Ultimately, the research yielded a methodology based on the Complete and Incomplete Elliptic Integrals of the First Kind and Second Kind. The analytical solution developed in this research - specifically the method for calculating the angles of deflections was compared against Finite Element Analysis and was found to produce nearly identical results. We conclude that the methodology shown can be extended to any number of point loads and will be a contribution to the field of non-linear mechanics.",

    "abstract": "We consider the steady group motions of a rigid body with a fixed point moving in a gravitational field. For an asymmetric top, rotation about the axis of gravity is the only permissible group motion; for a Lagrange top, simultaneous rotation about the axis of gravity and spin about the axis of symmetry of the top is permissible. Our analysis of the heavy top follows the reduced energy momentum method of Simo el a1 , which is applicable to a wide range of conservative systems with symmetry. Steady group motions are characterized as solutions of a variational problem on the configuration space; local minima of the amended potential correspond to nonlinearly orbitally stable steady motions. The combination of a low-dimensional configuration space and a relatively large number of parameters that produce substantial qualitative changes in the dynamics makes possible a thorough, detailed analysis, which not only reproduces the classical results for this well kno,w,,n-system, but leads to some results which we believe are new. *..tl.-...:\"n .,L \"LLC.IIIIII1.

Firstly, a co-rotational framework was fixed at the internal node of the element, it translates and rotates with the node rigidly; then, vectorial rotational variables were defined, they are three smaller components of the cross-sectional principal vectors at each node, sometimes they represent different components of the cross-sectional principal vectors in incremental solution procedure so as to avoid the occurrence of ill-conditioned tangent stiffness matrix; thereafter, the internal force vector and tangent stiffness matrix in local system was derived from the strain energy of the element as its first partial derivative and second partial derivative with respect to local variables, respectively, and a symmetric tangent stiffness matrix was achieved; finally, several examples were analysed to illustrate the reliability and accuracy of this procedure.",

Balancing multiple aspects of performance in the one geometric nonlinear analysis element remains challenging. We present a new shell element, flat shell DKMGQ-CR (Co-rotational Discrete Kirchhoff-Mindlin Generalized Conforming Quadrilateral), for linear and geometric nonlinear analysis of both thick and thin shells. The DKMGQCR shell element was developed by combining the advantages of high-performance membrane and plate elements in a unified coordinate system and introducing the co-rotational formulation to adapt to large deformation analysis. The effectiveness of linear and geometric nonlinear analysis by DKMGQ-CR is verified through the tests of several classical numerical benchmarks. The computational results show that the proposed new element adapts to mesh distortion and effectively alleviates shear and membrane locking problems in linear and geometric nonlinear analysis. Furthermore, the DKMGQ-CR demonstrates high performance in analyzing thick and thin shells. The proposed element DKMGQ-CR is expected to provide an accurate, efficient, and convenient tool for the geometric nonlinear analysis of shells.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, results are presented from tests of four reinforced concrete ͑RC͒ column-steel beam ͑RCS͒ subassemblies under large displacement reversals and dynamic analyses of RCS systems under various ground motions. The test specimens were designed following a strong column-weak beam philosophy and a deformation-based capacity design method for the connections. The effect of joint deformations on overall behavior of RCS frame systems was studied through a series of inelastic dynamic analyses performed on a six-story RCS frame with various joint modeling and design parameters. Results from this research show that RCS frame systems perform satisfactorily under seismic excitations. The test specimens showed a good strength and stiffness retention capacity with excellent energy dissipation up to displacement levels of approximately 5.0% drift. The joint deformation-based capacity design procedure was effective in controlling damage in the connection region, and thus forcing most of the inelastic activity to concentrate in the beam ends. From the analytical studies, it was found that joint deformations have a significant influence on maximum interstory drift of RCS frames. For the ground motions considered, an increase of up to 35% in maximum story drift was obtained when connection flexibility was considered in the analyses.",

    "abstract": "A solution algorithm is proposed for nonlinear structural analysis problems involving static and/or dynamic loads based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The main idea is to reformulate the equations of motion into a hypothetical dynamical system characterized by a set of ordinary differential equations, whose equilibrium points represent the solutions of the nonlinear structural problems. Starting from the Lyapunov stability theory, it is demonstrated theoretically that this hypothetical dynamical system is characterized by a global convergence to the equilibrium points for structural dynamics, i.e., the convergence is guaranteed independently of the selection of the initial guess. This feature overcomes the inherent limitations of the traditional iterative minimization algorithms and relaxes the restriction on the selection of the initial guess for various structural nonlinear behaviors. The validation of implementing the algorithm is demonstrated using a geometrically nonlinear pendulum problem with a closed-form exact solution. Moreover, comparisons between the proposed algorithm and Newton-Raphson type algorithms are presented using several numerical examples from structural statics and dynamics. Finally, the scalability of the proposed Lyapunov-based algorithm is discussed via adaptive switching of nonlinear solution algorithms at the problematic time steps.

    "abstract": "Differentiable programming is a fresh programming paradigm which composes parameterized algorithmic components and trains them using automatic differentiation (AD). The concept emerges from deep learning but is not only limited to training neural networks. We present theory and practice of programming tensor network algorithms in a fully differentiable way. By formulating the tensor network algorithm as a computation graph, one can compute higher order derivatives of the program accurately and efficiently using AD. We present essential techniques to differentiate through the tensor networks contractions, including stable AD for tensor decomposition and efficient backpropagation through fixed point iterations. As a demonstration, we compute the specific heat of the Ising model directly by taking the second order derivative of the free energy obtained in the tensor renormalization group calculation. Next, we perform gradient based variational optimization of infinite projected entangled pair states for quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and obtain start-of-the-art variational energy and magnetization with moderate efforts. Differentiable programming removes laborious human efforts in deriving and implementing analytical gradients for tensor network programs, which opens the door to more innovations in tensor network algorithms and applications.",

Then, a reformulated expression of the dissipated energy is presented, which is consistent from the thermodynamic point of view. This formulation is extended to the case of degrading BoucWen models.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an enriched hysteresis model with damage relying on the Bouc-Wen formulation, in which a single scalar variable is introduced to reproduce effects of strength and stiffness degradation emerging for damaging materials. First, some acknowledged limits of the original Bouc-Wen model are discussed, focusing on its thermodynamic admissibility and compatibility with Drucker’s plasticity postulate, and highlighting the effects of the parameters β and γ. Then, a reformulated expression of the dissipated energy is presented, which is consistent from the thermodynamic point of view. This formulation is extended to the case of degrading BoucWen models. Uniaxial validation analyses are proposed, together with some considerations on the physical and thermodynamic admissibility of the model.",

The Rio Colorado Bridge, near San Jose, Costa Rica, a new type of precast, prestressed suspension deck bridge, is presented as a general example in which basic design concepts were employed to produce a rationally designed structure. The main load-carrying material is high-strength steel prestressed to two times the stress in conventional suspension bridge cables. Concrete is the surfacing and stiffening material, prestressed to form the top and bottom chords of the suspension span.",

    "abstract": "This article offers a new conceptualisation of the meaning of norms in world politics. It starts from the observation that existing norm scholarship in International Relations has underestimated the role of ambiguity in the constitution of norm meaning. To address this shortcoming, we advance a conceptualisation that sees norm polysemy – the empirically observable plurality of norm meanings-in-use – as resulting from the enactment of inherently ambiguous norms in different contexts. By foregrounding norm ambiguity, this view offers a radically non-essentialist understanding of norm meaning, one that eschews any attempt to salvage final or “true” meanings behind the polysemy of norms. Using empirical illustrations from different fields of contemporary global governance, we identify four mechanisms through which actors practically cope with the multiplicity of norm meanings that arises from norm ambiguity (deliberation, adjudication, uni- or multilateral fixation attempts, and ad hoc enactment) and outline their varying effects on the legitimacy and effectiveness of global governance. Based on this discussion, the article points to the normative implications of a radically non-essentialist conception of norms and suggests harnessing the positive potential of norm ambiguity as an ethically desirable condition that promotes human diversity and the plurality of global life.",

    "abstract": "A general framework for finite element reliability analysis based on the first- and second-order reliability methods, FORM and SORM, is presented. New expressions for the required gradients of the response of geometrically nonlinear structures are derived and implemented in an existing finite element code, which is then merged with a FORM/SORM reliability code. The gradient computation does not require repeated solutions of the nonlinear response and is free of the errors inherent in the perturbation method. The proposed reliability method offers significant advantages over the conventional Monte Carlo simulation approach. The method is illustrated for a plate problem with random field properties, random geometry, and subjected to random static loads. The example represents the first application of the finite element method in conjunction with SORM, for a system reliability problem, and involving non-Gaussian random fields. Extensive analyses of reliability sensitivities with respect to parameters defining the random fields are carried out.",

    "abstract": "An array of 24 strong-motion accelerometers produced records for the New-Lian River Bridge, a five-span continuous bridge, during 25 February 1995 earthquake (weak motion) and 25 June 1995 earthquake (strong motion). This paper describes the application of linear discrete-time system identification methodology to the array of strong-motion measurements, in order to assess seismic response characteristics of the bridge. The structural system identification will concentrate not only on the global identification but also on the local structural system identification. Results of this application show that: (1) weak and strong ground excitation will induce significant differences on the dynamic response of the bridge; (2) linear models provide an excellent fit to the measured motions of the bridge from the records of these two seismic events; (3) the rigid-body rocking of the bridge pier during strong shaking is significant and cannot be ignored during identification; (4) the transverse motion at mid-span of the bridge is controlled by the quasi-static response from the boundary system and this phenomenon is quite significant during strong ground excitation. Also, systematic estimates of modal damping ratio and equivalent assessments of pier stiffness developed in the bridge during earthquake are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel consistent singularity-free strain-based finite element formulation for the analysis of three-dimensional frame-like structures. Our model is based on a geometrically exact finite-strain beam theory, quaternion parametrization of spatial rotations, assumption that the strain measures are constant along the length of the element and a proper choice of basis for the translational strain vector representation. As it is common for strain-based elements, the present formulation does not suffer from shear locking. A comparison of our results with the results from the literature and a commercial finite element analysis software demonstrates the advantages of the proposed formulation, especially when the structure is subjected to larger shear deformations. This stems from the fact that our model ensures a mathematically consistent updating procedure for all the quantities describing the beam. This aspect is often overlooked, since most of the numerical cases from other studies on this topic engage rather small-shear strains for which the consistent update is not crucial as the number of elements is increased.",

In view of this point, a simplified optimization calculation method of cable force for self-anchored suspension bridge has been developed based on optimization theories, such as minimum bending energy method, and internal force balanced method, influence matrix method. Meanwhile, combined with the weak coherence of main cable and the adjacently interaction of hanger forces, a simplified analysis method is developed using MATLAB, which is then compared with the optimization method that consider the main cable’s geometric nonlinearity with software ANSYS in an actual example bridge calculation. This contrast proves the weak coherence of main cable displacement and the limitation of the adjacent cable force influence. Furthermore, a tension program that is of great reference value has been developed; some important conclusions, advices, and attention points have been summarized.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in diverse applications; however, its use in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has emerged only recently. Here, we present an overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which embed a PDE into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation. The PINN algorithm is simple, and it can be applied to different types of PDEs, including integro-differential equations, fractional PDEs, and stochastic PDEs. Moreover, from the implementation point of view, PINNs solve inverse problems as easily as forward problems. We propose a new residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs. For pedagogical reasons, we compare the PINN algorithm to a standard finite element method. We also present a Python library for PINNs, DeepXDE, which is designed to serve both as an education tool to be used in the classroom as well as a research tool for solving problems in computational science and engineering. Specifically, DeepXDE can solve forward problems given initial and boundary conditions, as well as inverse problems given some extra measurements. DeepXDE supports complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid geometry, and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the user-friendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples. More broadly, DeepXDE contributes to the more rapid development of the emerging Scientific Machine Learning field.",

    "abstract": "It is shown that in large-deformation generalized plasticity a local maximum-dissipation postulate is equivalent to the condition that the plastic strain rate (in the sense of Rice) cannot oppose the total strain rate, when strain space is regarded as a l~iemannian manifold with the instantaneous Lagrangian tangent elastic stiffness as the metric tensor. From this condition, normality conditions in strain space (in this sense) and in the space of the second Piola-Kirehhoff stress (in the usual sense) are derived. With the additive decomposition of strain, the loading surface has essentially the same properties as in infinitesimal-strain plasticity. For the multiplieative decomposition, approximate normality rules are derived.",

Initially presented in uniaxial form, the model is then generalized to multiaxial stress. Numerical implementation is developed first through direct integration of the rate equations, including special cases in which the solution may be obtained analytically, and then by means of a return-map algorithm, which is particularly well suited to the finite-element method ; consistent algorithmic tangent moduli are derived as well. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the various approaches.",

    "abstract": "This study reviews and compares the most commonly used models for computing the local effects of hard missile impacts. The accuracies of the models in predicting perforation velocity are evaluated using a dataset of 95 impact tests collected from the literature. It is found that the majority of the models are unable to accurately predict perforation velocity or have a limited application range because of their empirical nature. To address these limitations, a semi-analytical model based on the Modified Compression Field Theory and the principle of work and energy is proposed. Unlike most existing models, the proposed model is capable of considering the influence of in-plane and shear reinforcement. The performance of the proposed model is assessed against experimental results obtained from the compiled dataset as well as other existing models.",

    "abstract": "The development of a reliable and robust surrogate model is often constrained by the dimensionality of the problem. For a system with high-dimensional inputs/outputs (I/O), conventional approaches usually use a low-dimensional manifold to describe the high-dimensional system, where the I/O data are first reduced to more manageable dimensions and then the condensed representation is used for surrogate modeling. In this study, a new solution scheme for this type of problem based on a deep learning approach is presented. The proposed surrogate is based on a particular network architecture, that is, convolutional neural networks. The surrogate architecture is designed in a hierarchical style containing three different levels of model structures, advancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the model in the aspect of training. To assess the model performance, uncertainty quantification is carried out in a continuum mechanics benchmark problem. Numerical results suggest the proposed model is capable of directly inferring a wide variety of I/O mapping relationships. Uncertainty analysis results obtained via the proposed surrogate have successfully characterized the statistical properties of the output fields compared to the Monte Carlo estimates.",

    "abstract": "This report describes an experimental and analytical program carried out for investigating the inelastic behavior of critical regions that may develop in a beam near its connection with the column of a reinforced concrete ductile moment-resisting space frame when subjected to severe earthquake excitations. In the experimental program, a series of nine cantilever beams, representing half-scale models of the lower story girder of a 20-story ductile moment-resisting reinforced concrete office building, were designed according to present seismic codes. These beams were designed in order to study the effects of (1) the slab by testing T-beams with a top slab width equal to the effective width specified by the ACI 318-71 Code; (2) relative amounts of top and bottom reinforcement by varying the amounts of bottom reinforcement; (3) supplementary ties by providing hairpin ties around the main bars not restrained by the corners of stirrup ties; (4) the high shear force by varying the shear-span ratio; and (5) loading histories by testing some beams under loading reversals inducing a gradually increased deformation, and others under monotonic loadings to large deformations in one direction. The significance of the experimental results in relation to the seismic design of the reinforced concrete critical region is discussed. Analytical studies were carried out to gain a better understanding of the flexure, shear, and bond-resisting mechanisms in the reinforced concrete critical regions subjected to inelastic load reversals.",

An outline of the normal range of variables in column design and a lower limit of applicability is proposed which will eliminate over 90 percent of columns in braced frames and almost half of columns in unbraced frames from consideration as slender columns.

    "abstract": "An analytical macromodel based on an equivalent strut approach integrated with a smooth hysteretic model is proposed for representing masonry infill panels in nonlinear analysis of frame structures. The hysteresis model uses degrading control parameters for stiffness and strength degradation and slip \"pinching\" that can be implemented to replicate a wide range of hysteretic force-displacement behavior resulting from different design and geometry. The paper presents the development of the hysteretic model and the definitions of the control parameters, which can be determined using any suitable theoretical model for masonry infills. An available theoretical model for simplified engineering evaluation of masonry infilled frames was explored for estimating the control parameters of the proposed macromodel. The macromodel was incorporated in a nonlinear structural analysis program, IDARC2D Version 4.0, for quasi-static cyclic and dynamic analysis of masonry infilled frames. Simulations of experimental force-deformation behavior of prototype infill frame subassemblies are performed to validate the proposed model. A lightly reinforced concrete frame structure is analyzed for strong ground motions to evaluate the influence of masonry infill panels on the dynamic response.",

    "abstract": "The concept of object-oriented programming ͑OOP͒ has redefined the design and development of large-scale codes worldwide and is now the order of the day in the software industry. Although OOP offers enormous potential in the scientific software business, this innovative programming technique has yet to find a niche in the development of structural engineering software. The present paper is an attempt to highlight the superior programming capability offered by the OOP approach in computer-aided analysis and design of civil engineering structures. The paper presents a brief theoretical background on the important basic and advanced concepts of OOP within the context of structural engineering. The paper explains the relevant fundamentals of object-oriented modeling and design in structural engineering for the orientation of civil engineering professionals who are new to the concept of OOP. The paper provides simple examples of object-oriented programs for elementary structural analysis to illustrate implementation of the OOP paradigm for computational structural analysis. User-code fragments with accompanying commentary are included to provide more detailed directions to structural engineers who wish to adopt the OOP paradigm. The paper also includes a brief review of the evolution that the computational programming paradigm has undergone over the past few decades to cope with the increasing complexity of software. A comparison of currently prevalent programming paradigms is presented to illustrate the relative advantages of OOP for large-scale software applications in structural engineering.",

The formulations are named Eulerian, total Lagrangian, and updated Lagrangian. The updated Lagrangian formulation can bypass the well-known singularity problem of p- the total Lagrangian formulation which is singular at the rotation angle 2π and its multiples. The u dated Lagrangian formulation has additional benefits such as a fully symmetrical stiffness tensor when applying a conservative loading. In addition, any time integration algorithm can be used because the changes of the rotation vector belong to the same tangent space of the rotation manifold SO(3). The updated Lagrangian formulation requires some secondary storage variables for the curvature and rotation vectors, at every spatial integration point.",

The beam formulation has several benefits such as all the unknown vectors belong to the same tangential vector space, no need for secondary storage variables, the path-independence in the static case, any standard time-integration algorithm may be used, and the symmetric stiffness.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the nonlinear theory of thin elastic shells with the displacement vector as the only independent variable we are concerned with the functional of total potential energy defined on a normed linear space, where the second Gâteaux differential of the functional is symmetric leading to a symmetric tangent stiffness matrix in finite element approximation procedures. On the other hand, in shell theories with displacement vector and rotation tensor as independent kinematical variables the corresponding functional is defined on a manifold without vector space structure. The question whether or not the second derivative and the associated tangent stiffness matrix are symmetric is controversely discussed in the recent literature. Using notions and methods of differential geometry we consider in this paper definition and symmetry property of the second differential of a functional defined on a finite dimensional manifold and Lie group (rotation group), respectively, and we discuss related problems and implications in detail. As it is shown the results obtained for linear spaces cannot be generalized to manifolds and Lie groups in a straightforward way. , In der nichtlinearen Schalentheorie mit dem Verschiebungsvektor als unabhängige Variable ist das Funktional der potentiellen Energie in einem genormten, linearen Raum definiert, wobei die zweite Gâteux‐Ableitung symmetrisch ist, was bei Finite‐Elemente‐Approximationen zu einer symmetrischen Steifigkeitsmatrix führt. Auf der anderen Seite ist bei nichtlinearen Schalentheorien mit Verschiebungsvektor und Rotationstensor als unabhängigen Variablen das entsprechende Funktional auf einer Mannigfaltigkeit ohne die Struktur eines Vektorraumes definiert. Die Frage, oh die zweite Ableitung des Funktionals und damit die zugehörige Steifigkeitsmatrix symmetrisch ist oder nicht, wird in der neueren Literatur kontrovers diskutiert. Unter Verwendung der Begriffe und Resultate der Differentialgeometrie werden in der vorliegenden Arbeit Definitionen und Symmetrieeigenschaften der zweiten Ableitung eines Funktionals auf einer endlich dimensionalen Mannigfaltigkeit bzw. Lie‐Gruppe untersucht und im Detail diskutiert. Dabei wird gezeigt, daβ die für den linearen Raum gültigen Ergebnisse nicht ohne weiteres verallgemeinert werden können.",

    "abstract": "The uplifting and rocking of slender, free-standing structures when subjected to ground shaking may limit appreciably the seismic moments and shears that develop at their base. This high-performance seismic behavior is inherent in the design of ancient temples with emblematic peristyles that consist of slender, free-standing columns which support freely heavy epistyles together with the even heavier frieze atop. While the ample seismic performance of rocking isolation has been documented with the through-thecenturies survival of several free-standing ancient temples; and careful post-earthquake observations in Japan during the 1940’s suggested that the increasing size of slender free-standing tombstones enhances their seismic stability; it was George Housner who 50 years ago elucidated a size-frequency scale effect that explained the “counter intuitive” seismic stability of tall, slender rocking structures. Housner’s 1963 seminal paper marks the beginning of a series of systematic studies on the dynamic response and stability of rocking structures which gradually led to the development of rocking isolation—an attractive practical alternative for the seismic protection of tall, slender structures. This paper builds upon selected contributions published during this last half-century in an effort to bring forward the major advances together with the unique advantages of rocking isolation. The paper concludes that the concept of rocking isolation by intentionally designing a hinging mechanism that its seismic resistance originates primarily from the mobilization of the rotational inertia of its members is a unique seismic protection strategy for large, slender structures not just at the limit-state but also at the operational state.",

    "abstract": "Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional steel reinforcements in concrete structures owing to their benefits of corrosion resistance, higher strength-to-weight ratio, reduced maintenance cost, extended service life, and superior durability. However, there has been limited research on non-destructive testing (NDT) methods applicable for identifying damage in FRP-reinforced concrete (FRP-RC) elements. This knowledge gap has often limited its application in the construction industry. Engineers and owners often lack confidence in utilizing this relatively new construction material due to the challenge of assessing its condition. Thus, the main objective of this study is to determine the applicability of two of the most common NDT methods: the Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Phased Array Ultrasonic (PAU) methods for the detection of damage in FRP-RC elements. Three slab specimens with variations in FRP type (glass-, carbon- and basalt-FRP, i.e., GFRP, CFRP, and BFRP, respectively), bar diameter, bar depths, and defect types were investigated to determine the limitations and detection capabilities of these two NDT methods. The results show that GPR could detect damage in GFRP bars and CFRP strands, but PAU was limited to damage detection in CFRP strands. The findings of this study show the applicability of conventional NDT methods to FRP-RC and at the same time identify the areas with a need for further research.",

    "abstract": "Performance of highway bridges during an intense seismic event is an issue of utmost importance. Of particular interest is the response of skewed highway bridges, where the skew angle and other related factors make the problem more complex. Although a number of studies had been carried out to address these issues in the past, most of them have neglected or over-simplified the soil–structure interaction effects, primarily relying upon the assumption that soil–structure interaction generally leads to a conservative estimation of seismic demands. The present study focuses on investigating the effect of skew angle on seismic response of a bridge-foundation system including nonlinear soil–pile interaction subjected to bi-directional ground motions. It has been observed that the rotational demand of the bridge deck is greatly affected by the skewness, indicating an increased vulnerability of skewed bridges due to rotational movement of the deck leading to deck unseating. It is also observed that the shear and moment demands of the piers increase significantly with increasing skew angle, as much as 54% and 37%, respectively. The maximum bending moment of the pile shaft is also found to increase upto 55%, indicating higher design requirements for the foundation components of the skew bridges compared to a similar normal bridge.",

    "abstract": "A stress‐strain model is developed for concrete subjected to uniaxial compressive loading and confined by transverse reinforcement. The concrete section may contain any general type of confining steel: either spiral or circular hoops; or rectangular hoops with or without supplementary cross ties. These cross ties can have either equal or unequal confining stresses along each of the transverse axes. A single equation is used for the stress‐strain equation. The model allows for cyclic loading and includes the effect of strain rate. The influence of various types of confinement is taken into account by defining an effective lateral confining stress, which is dependent on the configuration of the transverse and longitudinal reinforcement. An energy balance approach is used to predict the longitudinal compressive strain in the concrete corresponding to first fracture of the transverse reinforcement by equating the strain energy capacity of the transverse reinforcement to the strain energy stored in the concrete as a result of the confinement.",

The maximum load carrying capacity of the structure is determined by solving an optimization problem with linear equilibrium, compatibility and yield constraints together with a complementarity constraint that is treated using the penalty function method. Incorporation of the shear force effect at yield determines a nonlinear 3D yield surface that is linearized with appropriate polyhedra. The proposed method is implemented for the analysis of steel frames for rigid-perfectly plastic and isotropic hardening behavior. Numerical results are compared to those of axial force-bending moment interaction underlining the significant role of shear force effect especially for shorter members.",

    "abstract": "Integrating 3D bridge information modelling (BrIM) with construction technologies had inspired many researchers for the past decade. In this study, research objectives are intended to demonstrate the viability of integrating a 3D computer-aided design (3D-CAD) model with a structural analysis application and bridge cost estimation framework without compromising interoperability matters. An integrated model that relates a fuzzy logic decision support system with cost estimation for concrete box-girder bridges is presented. Model development methodology comprises an integrated preliminary cost estimation system (IPCES), and complex quality functions and deployment of a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. An actual case project is used to validate and illustrate model corresponding estimating capabilities. The proposed model is engineered to enhance existing techniques implemented by bridge stakeholders and designers to prepare cost estimates at the conceptual design stage by taking into consideration box-girder bridge project site preparations, substructure, and superstructure. The proposed model is anticipated to be of major significance to designers and its contribution resides into the integration of BrIM technologies with cost estimation approaches.",

These improvements unveil the connection to algorithmic differentiation theory. The choice between these two methods then hinges on a trade-off between ease of implementation and execution efficiency. Automatic implementations for Fortran and C/C++ are presented and their relative merits are discussed. These new methods were successfully implemented in two very large multidisciplinary programs and the resulting sensitivities are shown to be as accurate as the analyses. Accuracy and ease of implementation make these tools very attractive options for sensitivity analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In a standard design practice, it is often necessary to assemble engineered structures from individually manufactured parts. Ideally, the assembled system should perform as if the connections between the components were perfect, that is, as if the system were a single monolithic piece. However, the fasteners used in those connections, such as mechanical lap joints, are imperfect and highly nonlinear. In particular, these jointed connections dissipate energy, often through friction over highly localized microscale regions near connection points, and are known to exhibit history dependent, or hysteretic behavior. As a result, while mechanical joints are one of the most common elements in structural dynamics problems, their presence implies that assembled structural systems are difficult to model and analyze. Through rigorous experimental, analytical, and numerical work over the past century, researchers from several different disciplines have developed numerous damping models that give rise to the dynamical behavior attributed to joints. This work seeks to review, compare, and contrast several linear and nonlinear damping models that are known to be relevant to modeling assembled structural systems. These models are presented and categorized to place them in the proper historical and mathematical context as well as presenting numerous examples of their applications. General properties of hysteretic friction damping models are also studied and compared analytically. Connections are drawn between the different models so as to not only identify differences between models, but also highlight commonalities not normally seen to be in association.",

    "abstract": "In this work the geometrically exact three-dimensional beam theory has been used as basis for development of a family of isoparametric higher order large deformation curved beam elements. Geometrically exact three-dimensional beam theory has no restrictions with respect to the magnitude of displacements, rotations and deformations. While reduced integration may be used to alleviate transverse shear and membrane locking in linear and quadratic C0-continuous Lagrange elements, this does not automatically extend to higher order elements. In this study we demonstrate that uniform reduced numerical quadrature rules may be used to obtain locking-free isoparametric large deformation geometrically exact curved beam elements of arbitrary order. A set of carefully selected numerical examples serves to illustrate and assess the performance of the various geometrically exact elements and compare them with one of the most popular finite element formulations for solving nonlinear beam problems based on the corotational formulation.",

    "abstract": "The Cosserat brothers published in 1909 an original book where they favour a variational formulation of continuum mechanics together with an invariance which they call “‘Euclidean invariance’” of the Lagrangian-Hamiltonian action. This strategy places on an equal footing translations and possible rotational degrees of freedom, yielding in a natural way what is now commonly called the theory of Cosserat or oriented—or polar—continua with asymmetric stresses and the new notion of couple stresses. Here their landmark work is replaced in its epoch making context underlining the influences they benefited from and the influence they have exerted on their direct contemporaries and much later on (in the second-half of the twentieth century). The sociological scientific environment of the early twentieth century and the typical publication strategy of the time are outlined, explaining thus the Cosserats’ own strategy. The further reception of their work from 1909 to the Second World War and the revival of interest in it in the nineteen-fifties are examined critically. Finally, the formalization of their work in a new landscape of continuum thermo-mechanics created essentially by Truesdell is evoked together with other influences and further developments.",

    "abstract": "A number of recent research studies have provided insight into the seismic response characteristics of short-span overpass bridge systems. Application of system identification techniques to measured earthquake response data for this class of bridges has indicated that the bridge superstructure, abutments and approach embankment soil constitute a strongly coupled system. The dynamical behavior of the foundation and embankment soil have a first order influence on the dynamic response of the bridge superstructure. Analysis of measured strong motion response data has also indicated that localized nonlinear behavior of the embankment soil can result in significant nonlinear global behavior of the entire system, even when the bridge superstructure remains linear. The current paper presents the results of detailed numerical simulation studies of the dynamic response of a short-span overpass bridge system. Two distinctly different modeling approaches are investigated. The first approach utilizes simple reduced order “stick” model idealizations of the bridge, and the second approach utilizes a detailed, large scale, three dimensional finite element model. The detailed model includes a discretization of the soil embankments and a simple nonlinear material model is used to represent the hysteretic soil behavior. The sensitivity of bridge response to various parameters, such as deck skew, embankment soil stiffness and soil mass, stick model modal damping values, and soil nonlinearity has been investigated. Earthquake response predictions are performed with both model types and the response computations are compared to earthquake response data measurements. The ability of the models to accurately represent the bridge seismic response is discussed, and the two modeling approaches are compared and contrasted.",

    "abstract": "Object composition offers significant advantages over class inheritance to develop a flexible software architecture for finiteelement analysis. Using this approach, separate classes encapsulate fundamental finite-element algorithms and interoperate to form and solve the governing nonlinear equations. Communication between objects in the analysis composition is established using software design patterns. Root-finding algorithms, time integration methods, constraint handlers, linear equation solvers, and degree of freedom numberers are implemented as interchangeable components using the Strategy pattern. The Bridge and Factory Method patterns allow objects of the finite-element model to vary independently from objects that implement the numerical solution procedures. The Adapter and Iterator patterns permit equations to be assembled entirely through abstract interfaces that do not expose either the storage of objects in the analysis model or the computational details of the time integration method. Sequence diagrams document the interoperability of the analysis classes for solving nonlinear finite-element equations, demonstrating that object composition with design patterns provides a general approach to developing and refactoring nonlinear finite-element software.",

The user inputs the floor weights and story properties (stiffness, yield strength, hardening ratio) of the stories, and a damping ratio for the structure. The user selects from a series of included ground motion acceleration records, or user provided motions. The user can quickly explore the effect of changing weight, height, and stiffness on the tine history response. In addition nonlinear effects due to P-Delta and soft story mechanisms can be studied. For earthquakes, the loading is applied using a uniform excitation approach in which forces are applied at floor level using inertial forces. For wind, the forces are determined at floor level using a stochastic process that takes into account gust speed, exposure category, drag coefficient and building parameters such as height and width.",

The building is represented by a shear building model: an idealization of a structure in which the mass is lumped at the floor levels and the beams are assumed infinitely stiff in flexure and axially inextensible, and the columns are axially inextensible.

The user can quickly explore the effect of changing weight, height, and stiffness on the tine history response. In addition nonlinear effects due to P-Delta and soft story mechanisms can be studied. For this application the equations of motions are set up using the uniform excitation approach, i.e. MA + CV + KU = -MAg. A consequence of this approach is that the floor displacements solved for are relative displacements. These equations are solved using the Newmark constant acceleration method and Newton-Raphson solution algorithm.

Separate interfaces for linear equation solving, root finding algorithms, constraint handlers, and time integration methods are developed in order to give an analyst full control over a structural simulation. The software design also allows a developer to incorporate numerical modules from outside the structural engineering community. Example simulations demonstrate the modeling flexibility afforded by the framework.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we develop a rigidity theorem for algebraic families of rational maps and apply it to the study of iterative root-finding algorithms. We answer a question of Smale’s by showing there is no generally convergent algorithm for finding the roots of a polynomial of degree 4 or more. We settle the case of degree 3 by exhibiting a generally convergent algorithm for cubics; and we give a classification of all such algorithms. In the context of conformal dynamics, our main result is the following: a stable algebraic family of rational maps is either trivial (all its members are conjugate by Mobius transformations), or affine (its members are obtained as quotients of iterated addition on a family of complex tori). Our classification of generally convergent algorithms follows easily from this result. As another consequence of rigidity, we observe that the eigenvalues of a nonaffine rational map at its periodic points determine the map up to finitely many choices. This implies that bounded analytic functions nearly separate points on the moduli space of a rational map.",

In addition to being faster and more efficient than available DFT approaches, the method may be adopted to the processing of arbitrarily long excitations as a series of short, independent segments. The length of the individual segments may be chosen to optimize computational efficiency. The method consists of taking advantage of the periodicity implicit in the DFT approach and evaluating first the response of the system to a periodic extension of the excitation. A simple corrective solution is then superposed which converts the periodic response to the desired transient response. The method is illustrated by two numerical examples.$<$/p$>$",

The proposed formulation accounts for large deformations in three-dimensional problem settings consisting of slender, prismatic beams with arbitrarily curved initial geometries and arbitrary cross-section shapes. Like in geometrically exact Reissner theories the derived deformation measures are geometrically exact in the sense that they are consistent with the strong and weak form of the balance equations and the beam geometry for any configuration and for arbitrarily large translations, rotations and strains. A novel orthogonal interpolation strategy is applied to the triad field representing the cross-section orientation in order to fulfill the Kirchhoff constraint of vanishing shear strains in a strong sense and to preserve the objectivity of the spatially discretized problem. The continuity requirements resulting from the corresponding weak form are fulfilled by a cubic Hermite interpolation, thus leading to a C1-continuous representation of the beam centerline. Fundamental properties such as objectivity, path-independence, consistency and accuracy of the developed beam element are verified by means of suitable numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we suggest a locking-free geometrically exact finite element formulation incorporating the modes of axial tension, torsion and bending of thin Kirchhoff beams with arbitrary initial curvatures. The proposed formulation has been designed in order to represent general load cases and three-dimensional problem settings in the geometrically nonlinear regime of large deformations. From this comprehensive theory, we not only derive a general beam model but also several reduced formulations, which deliver accurate solutions for special problem classes concerning the beam geometry and the external loads. The advantages of these reduced models arise for example in terms of simplified finite element formulations, less degrees of freedom per element and consequently a higher computational efficiency of the corresponding numerical models. A second core topic of this publication is the treatment of membrane locking, which is a locking phenomenon predominantly occurring in highly slender curved structures, thus, exactly in the prime field of application for Kirchhoff theories. In order to address the membrane locking effect, we will propose a new interpolation strategy for the axial strain field and compare this method with common approaches such as Assumed Natural Strains (ANS) or reduced integration. The effectiveness of this method as well as the consistency and accuracy of the general finite element formulation and the reduced beam models will be illustrated with selected numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "The present work focuses on geometrically exact finite elements for highly slender beams. It aims at the proposal of novel formulations of Kirchhoff-Love type, a detailed review of existing formulations of Kirchhoff-Love and SimoReissner type as well as a careful evaluation and comparison of the proposed and existing formulations. Two different rotation interpolation schemes with strong or weak Kirchhoff constraint enforcement, respectively, as well as two different choices of nodal triad parametrizations in terms of rotation or tangent vectors are proposed. The combination of these schemes leads to four novel finite element variants, all of them based on a C1-continuous Hermite interpolation of the beam centerline. Essential requirements such as representability of general 3D, large-deformation, dynamic problems involving slender beams with arbitrary initial curvatures and anisotropic cross-section shapes, preservation of objectivity and path-independence, consistent convergence orders, avoidance of locking effects as well as conservation of energy and momentum by the employed spatial discretization schemes, but also a range of practically relevant secondary aspects will be investigated analytically and verified numerically for the different formulations. It will be shown that the geometrically exact Kirchhoff-Love beam elements proposed in this work are the first ones of this type that fulfill all these essential requirements. On the contrary, Simo-Reissner type formulations fulfilling these requirements can be found in the literature very well. However, it will be argued that the shear-free Kirchhoff-Love formulations can provide considerable numerical advantages such as lower spatial discretization error level, improved performance of time integration schemes as well as linear and nonlinear solvers or smooth geometry representation as compared to shear-deformable Simo-Reissner formulations when applied to highly slender beams. Concretely, several representative numerical test cases confirm that the proposed Kirchhoff-Love formulations exhibit a lower discretization error level as well as a considerably improved nonlinear solver performance in the range of high beam slenderness ratios as compared to two representative Simo-Reissner element formulations from the literature.",

    "abstract": "We propose in this paper a finite element formulation for three-dimensional beams undergoing large displacement and large rotations but small strains, many structures of mechanical and civil engineering belong to this class of problems. The main feature of this formulation concerns the treatment of finite rotations : by using the orthogonal matrix parametrization of 3D finite rotations and a nonlinear finite element interpolation of linearized rotations, we are able to provide a symetric tangent stiffness matrix leading to quadratic convergence of the incremental solution procedure, and the consistent linearization being affected by this approach. Several numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of this development.",

    "abstract": "A model for use in simulating the response of reinforced concrete interior beam–column joints is developed and evaluated using an extensive experimental data set. This model builds on previous work by Lowes and Altoontash in 2003, modifying the previously proposed model to improve prediction of response and extend the range of applicability. First, a new element formulation is proposed to improve simulation of joint response mechanisms. Second, a new method for simulating the shear stress-strain response of the joint core is developed. This method assumes joint shear is transferred through a confined concrete strut and simulates strength loss due to load history and joint damage following yielding of beam longitudinal steel. Third, modifications are made to enable better simulation of anchorage zone response. Comparison of simulated and observed response histories indicates that the new model represents well stiffness and strength response parameters for joints with a wide range of design parameters.",

The eccentric shear stress model that forms the basis of design according to the ACI Building Code (ACI 318-83) is found to not correlate well with the data. An alternate analysis model is proposed assuming that moment transfer strength is limited solely by available flexural reinforcement within an effective transfer width and is not influenced by connection shear. The proposed model correlates well with the experimental data and simplifies the design and analysis process.",

However, if one goes further and uses βη-conversion to prove equivalence of programs, then a gross simplification is introduced (programs are identified with total functions from values to values), that may jeopardise the applicability of theoretical results. In this paper we introduce calculi based on a categorical semantics for computations, that provide a correct basis for proving equivalence of programs, for a wide range of notions of computation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a theory for the buckling of short beams considering cross-sectional distortions due to transverse shear (i.e., shear warping), based on the consistent linearization of a geometrically nonlinear planar beam. The proposed deformation field considers the warping amplitude as an independent kinematic field, and the hyperelastic material assumes that the stresses normal and tangent to the deformed cross section are linear with respect to their work-conjugate finite strains. An approximate closed-form solution to the resulting quartic equation for the critical load is provided to facilitate practical implementation. Theoretical differences giving rise to distinct buckling theories for higher-order shear beams are discussed in terms of (1) the assumed deformation field, (2) variational consistency, and (3) material constitutive relation. The proposed formulation is applied to evaluate the stability of infinite strip unbonded fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolators (FREIs) with moderate-to-high shape factor, for which shear warping is expected to have a major influence due to the flexural flexibility of the fiber reinforcement. A homogenization procedure is described to obtain effective isolator rigidities considering rubber compressibility and fiber extensibility. Next, a finite element parametric study of the buckling of unbonded infinite strip FREIs is presented, and the results are used as a benchmark to evaluate the adequacy of the proposed and existing formulations. The theory presented herein and its approximate solution exhibit the best match with the numerical results, and the latter is deemed adequate for practical application.

    "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced elastomeric isolators (FREIs) have been proposed as a cost-effective solution for expanding the use of seismic isolation to normal-importance structures. By using lightweight fiber reinforcement and eliminating the attachment plates, FREIs reduce cost while improving the isolation efficiency and reducing tensile stresses in the rubber. However, the flexural flexibility of the fiber allows crosssectional distortions (i.e., warping) to occur, which significantly impacts the stability of these devices. This paper evaluates the buckling of rectangular, circular, and annular FREIs, taking into account shear warping effects. A planar buckling theory previously proposed by the authors is adapted for the three-dimensional problem, and effective warping rigidities and warping-related areas are derived for the above bearing geometries, accounting for rubber compressibility. To assess the adequacy of the proposed buckling theory and derived warping properties in predicting the buckling of FREIs, a parametric finite element study is conducted. The critical load predictions of the proposed analytical formulation are found to be in excellent agreement with those of the numerical simulations. It is shown that traditional estimations of the buckling load that neglect warping are significantly unconservative. Finally, design recommendations and resources are provided for practice-oriented applications. DOI: 10.1061/JENMDT.EMENG-7395. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

    "abstract": "The effects of inelastic buckling on monotonic and cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel bars are studied. Experimental tests show that this phenomenon occurs when the ratio between length and diameter of the bar exceeds 5, and that it leads to a postyield softening branch in compression that strongly influences the cyclic behavior of the bar. An analytical model of rebars accounting for inelastic buckling is presented, suitable for inclusion in programs for the analysis of rlc sections using the fiber type of discretization. The model employs four hardening rules (kinematic, isotropic, memory, and saturation) as functions of four independent parameters (yield stress, elastic modulus, hardening ratio, and a weighing coefficient). An explicit stress-strain relation in finite terms for loading branches is utilized. The model yields accurate results in predicting the cyclic behavior of rebars, both with and without inelastic buckling, for deformation paths of general nature.",

A program for analysis of axisymmetric solids was specifically developed for this work. The confinement models proposed follow a compression field modelling approach that combines nonlinear elasticity and plasticity-type modelling. In this paper, the formulations are corroborated by examining the behaviour of reinforced concrete columns confined with fibre reinforced polymers (FRP), steel, or a combination of both. The analytical responses agree well with the experimental results, showing the capabilities of the models to reasonably model pre- and post-peak behaviour, and strength enhancement.",

    "abstract": "It has been widely recognized that the behavior of confined concrete depends upon the level of confinement. Brittleness or ductility is a function of the state of compressive stresses, unconfined concrete strength, volumetric expansion, and concrete softening. Constitutive models for strength enhancement, concrete dilatation, and a new stress-strain relationship for concrete in triaxial compression are proposed. The load-carrying capacity of confined concrete is predicted by utilizing an Ottosen-type surface with newly developed coefficients that account for a wide range of confinement levels ͑lateral pressures up to 100% of the unconfined concrete strength͒ and unconfined concrete strengths from 20 to 130 MPa. Concrete dilatation is modeled as a function of the lateral pressure ratio and concrete strength and can reach values beyond the limit of uncompressibility. Experimental results are used to corroborate the new models at the material level, producing accurate agreement.",

    "abstract": "Cast steel energy dissipative components are increasingly being incorporated in structural systems in recent years. Cast steel yielding connectors (YC) demonstrate a stable symmetric hysteretic response with increased postyield stiffness at large deformations due to second-order geometric effects. In the present study, the seismic performance of a four-story steel structure equipped with cast steel YCs is investigated through pseudodynamic hybrid simulations using the University of Toronto 10-Element Hybrid Simulation Platform (UT10), where the structure is subjected to three maximum considered event (MCE)-level earthquakes. Four YCs in the seismic force–resisting system are represented physically, whereas the rest of the structure is modeled numerically. These experiments are performed as part of an initiative to produce a database of high-fidelity system-level benchmark test results and to critically study and improve existing numerical models, their calibration, and the loading protocols used in their calibrations. The experimental results can be used to study these aspects in the numerical models for YCs or systems with similar hysteretic characteristics. The hybrid simulations are followed by cyclic tests on two of the YCs to evaluate the remaining low-cycle fatigue life of the YCs and to provide information on the cumulative plastic ductility capacity of YCs.

Because of the unique feature of the method to combine physical testing with numerical simulations, it provides an opportunity to investigate the seismic response of structures in an efficient and economically feasible manner. It is this feature of the method which made it gain widespread use in recent years. This paper presents the theory of the method including an overview of the previous research related to various aspects of the method, an overview of two hybrid simulation applications, and the future directions for transforming the method to its next generation.",

A system identification technique is used to determine dynamical characteristics and high-fidelity first-order linear models of a bridge from low level earthquake excitations. A finite element model is developed and updated using a genetic algorithm optimization scheme to match the frequencies identified and to simulate data from a damaging earthquake for the bridge. Here, two criteria are used to determine the state of the structure. The first criteria uses the error between the data recorded or simulated by the calibrated nonlinear finite element model and the data predicted by the linear model. The second criteria compares relative displacements of the structure with displacement thresholds identified using a pushover analysis. The use of this technique can provide an almost immediate, yet reliable, assessment of the structural health of an instrumented bridge after a seismic event.

The two alternative finite element methods are described based on differing crack modeling approaches: smeared rotating cracks, implemented by the VecTor2 program, and smeared fixed cracks, implemented by the UC-win/WCOMD program. The Axial-Shear-Flexure Interaction approach, a method also based on smeared rotating cracks, is simplified, discussed and compared with the FEM analyses. Experimental and analytical results are compared for pre- and post-peak responses up to axial collapse of the columns. Both FEM methods resulted in satisfactory pre-peak predictions. Adequate post-peak simulations, until near complete loss of capacity, were achievable by the rotating crack method (VecTor2), especially for those columns exhibiting a shearcritical response. The simplified Axial-Shear-Flexure Interaction approach provided response envelope curves for the specimens comparable with the cyclic results obtained by the two FEM approaches.",

This method is based on a simplification of a consistent but relatively more complex approach known as the axial-shearflexure interaction ͑ASFI͒ method, which is able to predict the full load-deformation relationships of reinforced concrete columns subjected to axial, flexure and shear force. The uniaxial shear-flexure model ͑USFM͒, presented herein, can also predict comparable full load-deformation responses. In it, however, the computation-intensive iteration process for shear modeling used within the ASFI approach is eliminated and the formulation is simplified.

    "abstract": "The use of externally post-tensioned fiber-reinforced concrete decks in highway bridge structures is seen as a viable option in the move toward the design and construction of high-performance structures. However, with the thin unreinforced deck slabs that may result, punching shear is a potential concern. An experimental program is described in which the punching shear behavior of externally prestressed slabs is investigated, both with plain and fiber-reinforced concrete specimens. Results indicate that significant improvements in strength, ductility, energy absorption and nonbrittleness of failure can be achieved with fiber reinforcement. Nonlinear finite-element analysis procedures are used to model the specimens, and reasonably accurate simulations of behavior are obtained. Design code procedures are found to be unconservative in estimating the punching shear strength of these elements, whereas a commonly used analytical model is found to be overly conservative.",

In many problems of plastic deformation, when the prescribed loads or displacements do not increase ill proportion but vary in a complex manner, for instance alternating between prescribed limits, more general workhardening models are needed in order to describe the plastic behavior. One of such models, previously proposed by the author, is applied here in order to discuss superposition of fixed and alternating loads. In particular, the ease of steady tension and Mternating torsion is considered in detail and the rate of axiM strain accumulation is computed. There is a quMitative aggreement between theoretical prediction and experimental data.",

    "abstract": "With the aim of providing a tool for the comprehensive seismic analysis of steel moment resisting frames (MRFs), the paper presents the development of a structural model which is able to describe the deformation modes of the panel zone in beam-tocolumns joints, without resorting to a computationally heavy FE discretization. The model is able to take into account the finite dimensions of the joint, differently from the “‘scissor model’” currently adopted, and can incorporate the most recently proposed constitutive models for monotonic and cyclic loading. The proposed approach, based on a simple structural representation of the joint, does not modify the centre-to-centre line scheme and the nodal degrees of freedom usually adopted in the analysis of plane frames, but adds up to five more degrees of freedom to each node. These describe the deformation modes of the panel zone, namely extensional, flexural and due to shear. A non-linear behaviour can be associated to each of these modes; based on experimental results, a simple hysteretic model is proposed for the shear deformation. The panel zone model has been implemented in an ad hoc developed computer code for the non linear seismic analysis of steel MRFs (named STEFAN, STEel Frame ANalysis), including a non-linear fracturing beam model as well. As an example of application, the dynamic behaviour of a 5-bay 9-story frame designed according to Eurocodes 3 (EC3) and 8 (EC8) has been investigated, for different panel zone stiffness and with different models, both in the linear and non linear range, emphasizing the need for a correct panel zone modelling.",

    "abstract": "A four-field mixed variational principle is proposed for large deformation analysis of Kirchhoff rods with the lowest order C0 mixed FE approximations. The core idea behind the approach is to introduce a one-parameter family of points (the centerline) and a separate one-parameter family of orthonormal frames (the Cartan moving frame) that are specified independently. The curvature and torsion of the curve are then related to the relative rotation of neighboring frames. The relationship between the frame and the centerline is then enforced at the solution step using a Lagrange multiplier (which plays the role of section force). In case of Kirchhoff rods, the cross sectional orientation can be described using frames like the Frenet–Serret, which are defined only using the centerline, thereby demanding higher-order smoothness for the centerline approximation. Decoupling the frame from the position vector of the base curve leads to a description of torsion and curvature that is independent of the position information, thus allowing for simpler interpolations. The four-field mixed variational principle we propose has the frame, section force, extension strain and position vector as input arguments. We discretize the position vector using linear Lagrange shape functions, while the frames are interpolated as piecewise geodesics on the rotation group. Finite element approximations for extensional strain and section force are constructed using constant shape functions. Using these discrete approximations, a discrete mixed variational principle is laid out which is then numerically extremized. The discrete approximation is then applied to a few benchmark problems. Vis-á-vis most available approaches, our numerical studies reveal an impressive performance of the proposed method without numerical instabilities or locking.",

It is shown analytically that if the beam is sufficiently flexible, there are multiple equilibrium solutions for a specific beam and loading condition. A method is also presented for the determination of these deflected configurations. The cantilever beam studied in this research is considered to be initially straight and prismatic in addition to being homogeneous, elastic, and isotropic. The procedure outlined in this paper is utilized to show that for each combination of load and beam parameters, there are certain number of equilibrium configurations for a cantilever beam. The ranges of these combinations, along with some examples of the deflected shapes of the beams, are provided for several load inclination angles.",

The proposed model is based on the simple kinematic assumptions of the Timoshenko beam theory and holds for curved three dimensional frame elements with arbitrary cross-section geometry. The control sections of the frame element are subdivided into regions with 1D, 2D and 3D material response. The constitutive material model for reinforced and prestressed concrete follows the basic assumptions of the Modified Compression Field Theory with a tangent-stiffness formulation. The validity of the model is established by comparing its results with several well-known tests from the literature. These simulations include a variety of load combinations under bending, shear and torsion. The analytical results show excellent agreement with experimental data regarding the ultimate strength of the specimen and the local strain response from initiation of cracking to ultimate load.",

    "abstract": "In recent years nonlinear dynamic analysis of three-dimensional structural models is used more and more in the assessment of existing structures in zones of high seismic risk and in the development of appropriate retrofit strategies. In this framework beam finite-element models of various degrees of sophistication are used in the description of the hysteretic behavior of structural components under a predominantly uniaxial state of strain and stress. These models are commonly derived with the displacement method of analysis, but recent studies have highlighted the benefits of frame models that are based on force interpolation functions (flexibility approach). These benefits derive from the fact that models with force interpolation functions that reproduce the variation of internal element forces in a strict sense yield the exact solution of the governing equations in the absence of geometric nonlinearity. While the numerical implementation of force-based models at first appears cumbersome, simple examples of nonlinear analysis in this paper offer conclusive proof of the numerical and computational superiority of these models on account of the smaller number of model degrees of freedom for the same degree of accuracy in the global and local response. A numerical implementation that bypasses the iterative nature of the element state determination in recent force-based elements is also introduced, thus further expanding the benefits of flexibility-based nonlinear frame models.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a new element for geometrically nonlinear analysis of frame structures. The proposed formulation is flexibility based and uses force interpolation functions for the bending moment variation that depend on the transverse displacements and strictly satisfy equilibrium in the deformed configuration. The derivation of the governing equations and their consistent linearization are substantially more involved than for stiffness-based elements. Nonetheless, the element offers significant advantages over existing stiffness-based approaches, since no discretization error occurs and all governing equations are satisfied exactly. Consequently, fewer elements are needed to yield results of comparable accuracy. This is demonstrated with the analysis of several simple example structures by comparing the results from flexibility and stiffness-based elements.",

    "abstract": "Cable supported bridges are wind prone structures. Therefore, their aerodynamic behaviour must be studied in depth in order to guarantee their safe performance. In the last decades important achievements have been reached in the study of bridges under wind-induced actions. On the other hand, non-conventional design techniques such as sensitivity analysis or optimum design have not been applied although they have proved their feasibility in the automobile or aeronautic industries. The aim of this research work is to demonstrate how non-conventional design techniques can help designers when dealing with long span bridges considering their aeroelastic behaviour. In that respect, the comprehensive analytical optimum design problem formulation is presented. In the application example the optimum design of the challenging Messina Strait Bridge is carried out. The chosen initial design has been the year 2002 design proposal. Up to a 33% deck material saving has been obtained after finishing the optimization process.",

    "abstract": "Base isolation is accepted as the method of choice for mitigating the seismic risk of critical facilities, including hospitals. However, while many studies have confirmed the effectiveness of isolation in reducing seismic demands on attached nonstructural components, only a few have investigated the performance of unanchored building equipment and contents (ECs), and especially mobile ECs supported on wheels/casters, in base-isolated buildings. Motivated by the fact that about one-third of ECs in typical hospitals are supported on wheels/casters, this study investigated the seismic response of such ECs in base-isolated buildings through shake table tests. A comparative approach was adopted to examine the performance of lead-rubber bearing (LRB) and triple-friction pendulum (TFP) isolation systems against a conventional fixed-base hospital in reducing displacement and velocity demands on mobile ECs. It was observed that base isolation is effective in reducing seismic demands, especially velocity, on ECs. It was concluded that, in base-isolated buildings, locking the wheels/ casters on ECs reduces EC response. Fragility curves were developed for mobile ECs on unlocked wheels and casters in base-isolated buildings. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0002266. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

    "abstract": "This unforgettable memoir was the basis for the Academy Award-winning film 12 Years a Slave. This is the true story of Solomon Northup, who was born and raised as a freeman in New York. He lived the American dream, with a house and a loving family - a wife and two kids. Then one day he was drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery in the deep south. These are the true accounts of his twelve hard years as a slave - many believe this memoir is even more graphic and disturbing than the film. His extraordinary journey proves the resiliency of hope and the human spirit despite the most grueling and formidable of circumstances. Born a free man in New York State in 1808, Solomon Northup was kidnapped in Washington, D.C., in 1841. He spent the next 12 years as a slave on a Louisiana cotton plantation, and during this time he was frequently abused and often afraid for his life. This is his detailed description of slave life and plantation society.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops and demonstrates a mixed beam finite element that can represent the inelastic three-dimensional stability behavior of frames composed of open-walled cross-section members. The kinematics of deformation of the element include finite rotation and warping of the cross-section due to torsion. The material inelasticity is based on a two-space model that includes the effect of shear stresses due to uniform torsion in addition to normal stresses due to axial force, biaxial bending, and bimoment. Initial geometric imperfections and residual stresses are accommodated. The formulation is based on a two-field (displacement and generalized stress) Hellinger–Reissner (HR) variational principle. The interpolation of the generalized stresses (i.e., cross-section stress resultants) along the element length is based on the geometrically-exact nonlinear governing differential equations of equilibrium. This leads to significant improvements in the accuracy over conventional displacement-based elements in problems involving highly nonlinear variations in the curvature along the member lengths due to geometric nonlinearity and/or distributed plasticity effects. Several numerical examples involving two- and three-dimensional elastic and inelastic stability behavior are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the formulation.",

First, we propose two numerically stable solutions to the degenerate case of the logarithmic map (from SO(3) rotation matrices to so(3)-Lie algebra vectors) when the angle of rotation is close to or exactly pi. Second, we observe and theoretically prove that the Jacobian of the logarithmic map in a manifold sense (as the linear map between tangent spaces) can be found as a chain of Jacobians in a numerical sense of the logarithmic map and box plus operator via extending logarithmic map over the SO(3) manifold. Moreover, we show that the result of the chain rule does not depend on the extension of the log map, even though the numerical Jacobians of different extensions are different. These results ensure that we do not run into degenerate cases in practical implementations of optimization algorithms, such as with the Ceres solver library, for applications like pose graph optimization. We have proposed corresponding improvements to the implementation of SO3 in the popular Sophus library.",

His research then developed to focus primarily on the propagation of waves, and he made a major contribution to the mathematical theory of elastic wave propagation and became a world-leading authority in this area. He also made fundamental advances in the modelling of the thermo-elastic properties of rubberlike materials. At the University of East Anglia, where he was a professor for 26 years, he was the driving force behind the development of a research group in theoretical mechanics in the School of Mathematics and Physics, leading by example and supporting and encouraging fellow faculty members, especially the younger staff, academic visitors and students. He gave considerable service to the University of East Anglia in a number of capacities, including a period as Dean of the School, and to the scientific community, through substantial journal editorial activities and as a member of several national and international committees.",

Our presentation of the basic theory is distilled from the classic book of Davis (1979, Circulant Matrices, 2nd ed., Wiley, New York) with results, proofs, and examples geared specifically to vibration applications. Our aim is to collect the most relevant results of the existing theory in a single paper, couch the mathematics in a form that is accessible to the vibrations analyst, and provide examples to highlight key concepts. A nonexhaustive survey of the relevant literature is also included, which can be used for further examples and to point the reader to important extensions, applications, and generalizations of the theory.",

Furthermore, it is also valid for elastic rods which are subject to kinematical constraints, and it specializes to a linear theory of an elastic rod which is invariant under superposed rigid body motions. The construction of these theories is based on the method developed by Casey & Naghdi [1] who established similar theories for unconstrained nonpolar elastic bodies.",

For simplicity, attention is confined to infinitesimal deformations. The integration rules under consideration fall within the category of return mapping algorithms and follow in a straightforwardmanner from the theory of operator splittingapplied to elastoplastic constitutive relations. General rate-independent and rate-dependent behaviour, with plastic hardening or softening, associated or non-associated flow rules and nonlinear elastic response can be efficiently treated within the present framework. Isoerror maps are presented which demonstrate the good accuracy properties of the algorithm even for strain increments much larger than the characteristicstrains at yielding.",

    "abstract": "The construction industry has invested considerable effort into integration of project information in the last decade. One such effort is the definition of Industry Foundation Classes ͑IFCs͒ to facilitate data sharing across applications through a shared project model. In order to achieve the integration objectives, the industry software vendors need to commit to the implementation of IFC in their products. IFC is defined in EXPRESS, which is a platform-independent, object-flavored, data modeling language. The EXPRESS-based models must be translated into some programming language model for specific implementation. To achieve this, developers need to evaluate and select a suitable model and programming language for their implementation. Developers therefore need to understand both EXPRESS and a host of programming languages. This initial knowledge requirement may hinder the take-off or adoption of IFC-based implementation. This paper describes a software solution that reduces this initial knowledge requirement considerably by providing a .NET class library translation and an implementation view of the IFC model, based on the EXPRESS definitions. Complemented by the online documentation provided with the IFC definitions, the software provides a hierarchical view of the IFC-based programming objects with drill-down facility for developers to capture and appreciate the information requirement for specific objects.",

Numerically exact large static deformations of eight beams subjected to different loading and/or boundary conditions are obtained.

The proposed models are intended to provide substan- tial compatibility to nonlinear finite element analysis in the context of smeared rotating cracks in both the compression and tension stress regimes. The formulations are also easily adaptable to a fixed crack approach or an algorithm based on fixed principal stress directions. Features of the modeling include: nonlinear unloading using a Ramberg-Osgood formulation; linear reloading that incorporates degradation in the reloading stiffness based on the amount of strain recovered during the unloading phase; and improved plastic offset formulations. Backbone curves from which unloading paths originate and on which reloading paths terminate are represented by the monotonic response curves and account for compression softening and tension stiffening in the compression and tension regions, respectively. Also presented are formulations for partial unloading and partial reloading.",

    "abstract": "The finite-element method for simulating the nonlinear behavior of reinforced concrete structures has progressed to the point where it is close to being a practical everyday tool for design engineers. Further advancements have made the analysis of arbitrary loading conditions, including reverse cyclic loading or earthquake-type loading, feasible. Recent criticism has questioned the practicality, reliability, and robustness of the finite-element method due to perceived complexities involved in developing the model and interpreting the results. A series of analyses are presented on reinforced concrete structural walls of varying height-to-width ratio, varying wall cross section, and varying levels of reverse cyclic loading to demonstrate that the finite-element procedure is capable of providing quick and reliable simulations, while employing simple modeling techniques. The modeling herein utilizes low-powered rectangular membrane elements, and material properties are smeared within the elements. Behavioral aspects such as ultimate strength, displacements, postpeak ductility, energy dissipation, and failure mechanisms are well simulated.",

The preliminary constitutive models used in the analysis programs, for reinforced concrete subjected to arbitrary loading conditions including cyclic loading, are reviewed. The analytical results of shear walls are compared to the experimentally observed behaviour, demonstrating reasonably accurate simulations of behaviour.

    "abstract": "Beam-column connections undergo significant shear deformations and greatly contribute to story drifts during earthquake loading, yet their response is typically neglected in traditional frame analyses through the use of rigid end offsets. Although local joint models are available in the literature for the investigation of single, isolated joints, there is a lack of holistic frame analysis procedures simulating the joint behavior in addition to important global failure modes such as beam shear, column shear, column compression, and soft story failures. The objective of this study is to capture the impact of local joint deformations on the global frame response in a holistic analysis by implementing a joint model into a previouslydeveloped global frame analysis procedure. The implemented joint element simulates the joint shear deformations and bar-slip effects. Concrete confinement effects are also considered so that both older and modern joints can be modeled. The developed procedure successfully captures the local loaddeflection response of joints within a global frame analysis procedure. The ratio of predicted and observed peak load had a mean of 1.25 before the modification, and a mean of 1.05 after the modification. Ó 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "A continuum-based variational principle is presented for the formulation of the discrete governing equations of partitioned structural systems. This application includes coupled substructures as well as subdomains obtained by mesh decomposition. The present variational principle is derived by a series of modiÿcations of a hybrid functional originally proposed by Atluri for ÿnite element development. The interface is treated by a displacement frame and a localized version of the method of Lagrange multipliers. Interior displacements are decomposed into rigid-body and deformational components to handle oating subdomains. Both static and dynamic versions are considered. An important application of the present principle is the treatment of nonmatching meshes that arise from various sources such as separate discretization of substructures, independent mesh reÿnement, and global–local analysis. The present principle is compared with that of a globalized version of the multiplier method. Copyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "A generalized fiber beam element formulation is proposed to accurately capture the formation of multiple plastic regions with a coarse mesh, which usually occurs in the process of structural collapses. The strong gradient of displacement near plastic regions in a fiber beam element can be accurately described using a special plastic enrichment function. The two types of the plastic enrichment functions are suggested for the cases where the plastic region is located fully inside an element and spread over a node, respectively. In this approach, the optimal shape of the plastic enrichment function can be updated by reflecting plastic deformation at the previous loading step. Furthermore, if plastic regions appear in multiple locations in an element, the corresponding plastic enrichment function can be adaptively reconstructed on the basis of plastic region distribution without introducing additional degrees of freedom. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated in terms of accuracy and computational cost through several numerical experiments.",

To make prototyping easier, PyTorch does not follow the symbolic approach used in many other deep learning frameworks, but focuses on differentiation of purely imperative programs, with a focus on extensibility and low overhead.

    "abstract": "Cyclone and Hurricanes are one of the natural causes of devastating forces. Many destructive cyclone such as Cyclone Vayu (2019), Cyclone Fani (2019), Cyclone Gaja (2018), Cyclone Nilofar (2014), Cyclone Phailin (2013) and others have affected major cities with heavily occupied residential or business areas. Due to these natural calamities buildings are affected to a great extent causing major loss to individuals and nation. This necessitate development of some reliable method for assessment of the building under expected level of wind storms. Wind Performance Based analysis approach is used to predict the performance of the building under extreme wind events. For performance based analysis primarily wind time history data are required as input parameter. In practice, various procedures like Anemometers, Doppler radar and Laser-based LIDAR or wind tunnel test are used for esti­ mating wind time history data. However, all these procedures are time consuming and expen­ sive. As an alternate to these methods an analytical procedure for generation of wind time history point load data is presented in this paper. Aerodynamic database developed by TPU (Tokyo Polytechnic University) is adopted for generation of wind time history data. TPU aerodynamic database provides wind pressure data of low-rise and high-rise building based upon wind tunnel tests. An example is presented to illustrate the procedure to generate wind time history.",

    "abstract": "A novel formulation termed the “integrated force method” (IFM) has been developed in recent years for analyzing structures. In this method all the internal forces are taken as independent variables, and the system equilibrium equations (EEs) are integrated with the global compatability conditions (CCs) to form the governing set of equations. In IFM the CCs are obtained from the strain formulation of St. Venant, and no choices of redundant load systems have to be made, in contrast to the standard force method (SFM). This property of IFM allows the generation of the governing equation to be automated straightforwardly, as it is in the popular stiffness method (SM). In this paper IFM and SM are compared relative to the structure of their respective equations, their conditioning, required solution methods, overall computational requirements, and convergence properties as these factors influence the accuracy of the results. Overall, this new version of the force method produces more accurate results than the stiffness method for comparable computational cost.",

The aim of the described object oriented environment is not only to be an efficient and robust tool for FEM computations, but also to provide a modular and extensible tool for new developments. The program structure has been designed to meet all natural requirements for modularity, extensibility, and robustness. Special attention is put on the description of the representations and interfaces of the material model and the analysis module. For reader convenience, a short introduction to Object Oriented Analysis is given. The program structure design presented has been successfully implemented.",

The project is located in a zone of very difficult environmental conditions characterized by deep soil strata of weak silty clays over depths in excess of 80 m, a high water depth (60 m) and a very strong seismic design motion with a peak ground acceleration of 0.48 g at mudline level. All these constraints have called for an original design of the foundations which minimizes the overall cost of the bridge, has a small impact on the environment and requires advanced design tools to account for the pronounced soil-structure interaction under seismic conditions.",

    "abstract": "One of the most popular hysteretic models used in many areas of engineering, especially the civil one, is the Bouc-Wen model. Although this model is able to simulate several types of hysteretic phenomena, it cannot describe some typical phenomena, such as cyclic degradation of strength and stiffness, pinching effect, and so on. For this reason, many researchers have proposed several variants of the original Bouc-Wen model. We present a review of the Bouc-Wen model and its most significant enhanced versions, utilizing the same technical terminology for all models in order to clarify and to shed some light on the number and physical significance of the parameters that the models require as input. Sensitivity analyses are also illustrated with respect to the input parameters.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the equilibrium problem of von Mises trusses in nonlinear elasticity. A general loading condition is considered and the rods are regarded as hyperelastic bodies composed of a homogeneous isotropic material. Under the hypothesis of homogeneous deformations, the finite displacement fields and deformation gradients are derived. Consequently, the Piola-Kirchhoff and Cauchy stress tensors are computed by formulating the boundary-value problem. The equilibrium in the deformed configuration is then written and the stability of the equilibrium paths is assessed through the energy criterion. An application assuming a compressible Mooney-Rivlin material is performed. The equilibrium solutions for the case of vertical load present primary and secondary branches. Although, the stability analysis reveals that the only form of instability is the snap-through phenomenon. Finally, the finite theory is linearized by introducing the hypotheses of small displacement and strain fields. By doing so, the classical solution of the two-bar truss in linear elasticity is recovered.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a smooth hysteresis model for reinforced concrete (RC) structural elements based on the differential equation of the Bouc–Wen model. Stiffness degradation and strength degradation are defined by introducing a damage index that includes both dissipated energy and maximum displacement. The pinching effect acts directly on the stiffness of the system and is controlled by an activation energy. The degrading functions are connected to the actual processes with which the damage occurs, thereby giving each parameter a physical meaning. The simple formulation of the model allows a straightforward identification of the best-fitting parameters and an easy interpretation of the results. Applications to the cyclic behaviour of RC structural elements demonstrate that the model is well capable of describing complex hysteretic behaviours involving degradation and pinching effects.",

The framework allows users easy access to the FEA program and the analysis results by using a web-browser or other application programs, such as MATLAB. In addition, the framework enables new as well as legacy codes to be incorporated from disparate sites in a dynamic and distributed manner. To provide flexible project management and data access, a database system is employed to store project-related information and selected analysis results. The prototype framework demonstrates that the Internet can potentially enhance the flexibility and extendibility of traditional FEA programs.",

    "abstract": "OpenBIM is a universal approach to collaborative design, construction and maintenance of buildings. This technology allows a transparent and open workflow, facilitating the participation of all intervening technicians in a coordinated and simultaneous way, regardless of the software tools they use. The process of calculation and structural design can be integrated into the OpenBIM workflow without complicating or modifying the way of working that has traditionally been carried out. To this end, CYPE has recently created applications integrated in the OpenBIM flow to analyze and design structures such as StruBIM Analysis, in addition to adapt the existing ones. StruBIM Analysis is a new software to calculate the structure, that is to say, it obtains nodal displacements, sectional forces of one-dimensional elements and shell forces by means of FEM analysis. StruBIM Analysis integrates OpenSees as its calculation engine. OpenSees is a well-known framework developed by University of California: Berkeley, which performs complex calculations efficiently. This calculation engine has the data entry through code and the result output without graphical interface. However, thanks to the integration of OpenSees in an OpenBIM workflow, calculating non-linearly building structures with a dynamic analysis with integration over time will be possible in a user-friendly and reliable way.",

    "abstract": "The paper develops a systematic procedure for formulating finite elements on manifolds. Theoretical developments give rise to a modular computational framework for composing coordinate transformations and manifold parameterizations. The procedure is demonstrated with the Cosserat rod model, furnishing a novel finite element formulation that rectifies the lack of objectivity exhibited by existing finite elements without violating the director constraints or compromising the symmetry of the tangent stiffness at equilibrium. The framework is element-independent, allowing its implementation as a wrapper to existing element libraries without modification of the element state determination procedures.",

    "abstract": "As demand for digital twins continues to grow, keeping pace with the swift progress of artificial intelligence in the field presents a challenge. This paper addresses this issue by formalizing five key abstract concepts related to structural health and investigates the representation of these abstractions in production-level software frameworks. The approach aims to unite data-driven technologies with classical methods of structural mechanics to achieve seamless integration between modern parameter-based techniques and conventional finite element models. The framework is demonstrated through a full-scale implementation centered around 22 bridges in the California highway network where a myriad of both data-driven and conventional structural health monitoring procedures is employed, supporting both the scalability and adaptability in the proposed framework.",

API Improvements In addition to substantial performance gains over upstream, the following improvements have been made to the API: Modeling new section argument added to fiber, patch and layer commands. Eliminates need for precarious dependence on global state from Python. new pattern argument added to load command; eliminates need for precarious dependence on global state from Python. new Model class eliminates need for precarious dependence on global state from Python. Removed hard-coded limit on fibers; currently upstream will produce undefined behavior is too many fibers are used. Interpreter new printA features: does not require FullGen solver; now all one needs to do is call model.getTangent(). This is possible due to the new consolidated memory ownership model. new -m, -c, -k options allow custom linear combinations of $\\mathbf{M}$, $\\mathbf{C}$ and $\\mathbf{K}$: C = model.getTangent(c=1.0) or in Tcl: printA -c 1.0 the fiber section parser has been completely reimplemented to follow a reasonable programming paradigm. improved print command new -registry option. more reliable JSON printing includes MP_Constraint information new -det option for static integrators: ArcLength, ... fix changing reference load in static integrators new -det capability for solvers: FullGenLapack, Umfpack, BandGenLapack Verbosity control; use OPENSEESRT_VERBOSITY new export command in Python and Tcl, when run through Python new getTangent() method for Model class in Python new invoke Tcl command and Python constructs Tcl Only new progress command in Tcl new = command, fixes vexing operator precedence in expr",

    "abstract": "In this work we briefly discuss some concepts of structural reliability as well as the optimization algorithm that is commonly used in this context, called HLRF. We show that the HLRF algorithm is a particular case of the SQP method, in which the Hessian of the Lagrangian is approximated by an identity matrix. Motivated by this fact, we propose the HLRF–BFGS algorithm that considers the BFGS update formula to approximate the Hessian. The algorithm proposed herein is as simple as the HLRF algorithm, since it requires just one function and gradient evaluation at each iteration and the new iterate is given by a recursive formula. Comparative numerical experiments on a set of problems selected from the literature are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm and the results indicate that the HLRF–BFGS algorithm has the advantage of being more robust and efficient with respect to the function and gradient evaluation, than HLRF.",

    "abstract": "Harnessing modern parallel computing resources to achieve complex multiphysics simulations is a daunting task. The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) aims to enable such development by providing simplified interfaces for specification of partial differential equations, boundary conditions, material properties, and all aspects of a simulation without the need to consider the parallel, adaptive, nonlinear, finite element solve that is handled internally. Through the use of interfaces and inheritance, each portion of a simulation becomes reusable and composable in a manner that allows disparate research groups to share code and create an ecosystem of growing capability that lowers the barrier for the creation of multiphysics simulation codes. Included within the framework is a unique capability for building multiscale, multiphysics simulations through simultaneous execution of multiple sub-applications with data transfers between the scales. Other capabilities include automatic differentiation, scaling to a large number of processors, hybrid parallelism, and mesh adaptivity. To date, MOOSE-based applications have been created in areas of science and engineering such as nuclear physics, geothermal science, magneto-hydrodynamics, seismic events, compressible and incompressible fluid flow, microstructure evolution, and advanced manufacturing processes.",

    "abstract": "The paper describes a procedure for the non-linear analysis of structures which are an assemblage of beams with material non-linearities of general type; the approach uses the equilibrium integrals and a consistent iterative formulation at the element level, within the general framework of the displacement method for the solution of the global structural problem. The application of di erent approaches to the non-linear beam problem is presented and discussed including the traditional sti ness and exibility approach and some mixed formulations. The proposed equilibrium-based approach is shown to be more accurate and more robust than the traditional compatibility-based approach, on which most of the non-linear beam elements available today are based. Similar advantages are also found with respect to an approach based on the three-ÿeld mixed assumed strain method.",

    "abstract": "We summarize several previously published geometrically nonlinear EAS elements and compare their behavior. Various transformations for the compatible and enhanced deformation gradient are examined. Their effect on the patch test is one main concern of the work, and it is shown numerically and with a novel analytic proof that the improved EAS element proposed by Simo et al in 1993 does not fulfill the patch test. We propose a modification to overcome that drawback without losing the favorable locking-free behavior of that element. Furthermore, a new transformation for the enhanced field is proposed and motivated in a curvilinear coordinate frame. It is shown in numerical tests that this novel approach outperforms all previously introduced transformations.",

    "abstract": "The enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method is one of the most frequently used methods to avoid locking in solid and structural finite elements. One issue of EAS elements in the context of geometrically nonlinear analyses is their lack of robustness in the Newton–Raphson scheme, which is characterized by the necessity of small load increments and large number of iterations. In the present work we extend the recently proposed mixed integration point (MIP) method to EAS elements in order to overcome this drawback in numerous applications. Furthermore, the MIP method is generalized to generic material models, which makes this simple method easily applicable for a broad class of problems. In the numerical simulations in this work, we compare standard strain-based EAS elements and their MIP improved versions to elements based on the assumed stress method in order to explain when and why the MIP method allows to improve robustness. A further novelty in the present work is an inverse stress-strain relation for a Neo-Hookean material model.",

    "abstract": "For conventional buildings, design codes are written such that minimally compliant buildings should achieve code-defined collapse probabilities under maximum considered events (MCE); however, there is no systematic methodology to ensure this is true for isolated buildings. Iterative design in which a building is designed, its collapse probability is assessed via incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), and the design is adjusted is inefficient given the number of permutations in the building-isolation system design. In an effort to find acceptable design parameters to achieve desired levels of collapse in early stages, full non-linear dynamic analysis can be bypassed through the use of data-driven predictive modeling. Gaussian process (GP) regression is utilized to fit and predict isolated building performance based on a generalized database. A sequential adaptive design of experiment (DoE) method is then used to strategically select training points to minimize the predictive variance of the GP model, and the model is then used to predict collapse probabilities for isolated structures. From here, designs that admit higher collapse probabilities than the threshold are removed, and cost optimization is performed to inversely select designs parameters such that the building will meet the targeted collapse probability under the MCE. Using this information, discussion on necessary required design parameters (e.g., moat clearance and strength reduction ratio) is given.",

Some algebraic relations concerning the finite rotations are reviewed. Formulae expressing them in terms of displacements are given. Along each of the curvilinear coordinate lines the finite rotations are shown to satisfy some systems of the linear first-order differential equations. Each system of the equations is presented in four different but equivalent forms associated with an intermediate stretched basis or with an intermediate rotated basis. Inte~b~ity conditions of the system of equations provide various alternative forms of compati~ity conditions in cont~uum mechanics. The displacement field is expressed through the stretch and rotation fields in the form of three successive line integrals. The formula describes the displacements to within a constant finite translation and a constant finite rotation. The procedure proposed here generalizes the formula derived by CesLo (1906)within the classical linear theory of elasticity.",

    "abstract": "A fully conserving algorithm is developed in this paper for the integration of the equations of motion in nonlinear rod dynamics. The starting point is a re-parameterization of the rotation field in terms of the so-called Rodrigues rotation vector, which results in an extremely simple update of the rotational variables. The weak form is constructed with a non-orthogonal projection corresponding to the application of the virtual power theorem. Together with an appropriate time-collocation, it ensures exact conservation of momentum and total energy in the absence of external forces. Appealing is the fact that nonlinear hyperelastic materials (and not only materials with quadratic potentials) are permitted without any prejudice on the conservation properties. Spatial discretization is performed via the finite element method and the performance of the scheme is assessed by means of several numerical simulations.",

For an arbitrary compressible material, the cylinder will under radial and angular deformation. These axisymmetric fields are governed by pair of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, one of which is second-or the other first-order.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a formulation for limit analysis of three-dimensional masonry structures discretized as rigid block assemblages interacting through no-tension and frictional contact interfaces is developed. Linear and piecewise linearized yield functions are used for rocking, sliding and torsion failure. A simple yield condition has been defined to take into account interaction effects of shear force with torsion and bending moment. Associative flow rules are considered for strain rates. On the basis of the developed governing equations, the limit analysis problem has been formulated as a nonlinear mathematical program. An iterative solution procedure based on linear programming is used to solve the limit analysis problem and to take into account nonlinearities due to the influence of bending moments and shear stresses on torsion strength. The results of experimental investigations on out-of-plane masonry walls constrained at one edge and different examples from literature were considered for validation. Comparison with existing formulations is carried out.",

The method uses dual-Schur domain decomposition to divide a large finite element mesh into a number of smaller subdomains, which are solved independently using a suitable mesh-size and timestep to capture the local spatial and temporal scales of the problem. Continuity of the solution between subdomains is enforced by Lagrange multipliers. It is shown that the proposed method is stable, accurate and computationally more efficient than using a uniform time-step for the entire mesh. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate and corroborate these properties.",

New algorithms of this kind are introduced for finite element approximations. The use of these methods for the Neumann problem for Laplace’s equation and important issues of implementation are discussed in some detail. It is shown that the new methods offer considerable advantages in comparison with finite difference-capacitance matrix methods previously employed.",

Subsequently, using ideas of literate programming, it is explained how these algorithms have been implemented in the PyFEM code, which contains the basic numerical tools needed to build a finite element code. Some of the solution techniques, element formulations, and material models treated in this book have been added. These tools are used in a series of example programs with increasing complexity.",

FeView offers an open-source and stand-alone windows system that is very easy and simple to use.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) continuum nonlinear analysis of the Meloland Road Overpass (MRO) near El Centro, California. The modeling methodology and the computational tools are discussed in detail. The performance of the computational model is evaluated by comparing the computed responses with the responses recorded at the bridge site during the 1979 Imperial Valley and 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquakes. Amongst the recorded earthquake events at the bridge site, these two events caused the strongest shaking. The comparison shows that the 3D model is potentially an effective tool for detailed analysis of a full bridge system including foundation soils, pile foundations, embankments, supporting columns, and the bridge structure itself in a unified system without relying on any ancillary models such as Winkler springs. Additional response parameters such as displacements, rockings, and bending moments are also evaluated although none of these was measured during the seismic events.",

    "abstract": "This paper evaluates the commonly used substructuring method for analysis of bridge systems where the bridge is divided into two sub-systems: the bridge superstructure and the substructure including the pile foundations, abutments, and soil. Modeling of the soil-structure interaction (SSI) in the system is simplified by replacing the pile foundations, abutments, and soil with sets of independent equivalent linear springs and dashpots at the base of the superstructure. The main objective of the paper is to examine how well the substructuring method simulates the seismic response of a bridge system. The baseline data required for the evaluation process is derived from analyzing a fully-coupled continuum bridge model, already validated for the instrumented two-span Meloland Road Overpass. The same bridge system is also simulated using the substructuring method. The results from both approaches are compared, and it is shown that the differences between them can be significant. The substructuring method consistently overestimates the pier base shear forces and bending moments and the pier top deflections. Moreover, the spectral response of the bridge structure is mispredicted. The analyses are repeated for a three-span bridge system subjected to several ground motions, leading to a similar observation as before. Hence, the current state of practice for simulating seismic SSI in bridges using the substructure model is shown to be too simplified to capture the major mechanisms involved in SSI.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel fiber force-based finite element to predict the nonlinear static response of reinforced concrete frame/wall structures incorporating the axial force – bending moment – shear force interaction. The proposed formulation is especially suited for short elements with low span to depth ratio, where shear dominant behavior can be expected. An iterative algorithm is developed to find the transverse strain that results in negligible transverse clamping stresses, to obtain a complete strain state at the fiber level. The axial force – bending moment – shear force interaction is considered at the fiber level by computing the corresponding stress state for a given strain state through Modified Compression Field Theory. A new algorithm is developed for section state determination that iteratively updates the section deformation vector until section level equilibrium is satisfied, eliminating the generation of residual section deformations that violates compatibility. Hence, an iterative procedure is not required at the element state determination. The proposed method of explicitly satisfying equilibrium at the section level improves upon the existing force based finite element formulations, in which section level equilibrium is only implicitly satisfied by limiting the residual element deformations at the element level. The proposed element has been tested with experimental data of short structural walls in order to demonstrate the capability of predicting the axial force – bending moment – shear force interaction. The proposed formulation is stable and provides excellent agreement with experimental data.",

In this work a new algorithm for automating the formulation and assembly of hyperelastic higher-order structural finite elements is developed. A hierarchic series of kinematic models is proposed for modeling structures with special geometries and the algorithm is formulated to automate the study of this class of higher order structural models. The algorithm developed in this work sidesteps the need for an explicit derivation of the governing equations for the individual kinematic modes. Using a novel procedure involving a nodal degree-of-freedom based automatic assembly algorithm, automatic differentiation and higher dimensional quadrature, the relevant finite element matrices are directly computed from the variational statement of elasticity and the higher order kinematic model. Another significant feature of the proposed algorithm is that natural boundary conditions are implicitly handled for arbitrary higher order kinematic models. The validity algorithm is illustrated with examples involving linear elasticity and hyperelasticity.",

    "abstract": "Modified R3 testing has been used to classify four different SCMs, namely, limestone, pumice, slag, and densified silica fume. Cementitious pastes were prepared by replacing ordinary portland cement with SCMs at different replacement levels – 20%, 40%, and 60% for limestone, pumice, and slag and 5%, 10%, and 15% for silica fume. The influences of SCM replacement level on heat flow, heat release, calcium hydroxide consumption, bound water contents, compressive strength, and bulk resistivity for a period of 56 days were quantified. The SCMs have widely varying effects on these properties as a function of replacement levels, however, in general, inert and reactive SCMs show little difference in properties at early ages and lower replacement levels (20%). The impacts of SCMs on cementitious paste properties are more apparent at higher replacement levels (40%–60%) and at later ages (28 and 56 days). These findings have important implications in practice and suggest that standard ASTM strength activity index testing could be improved by testing at higher replacement levels. In addition, bulk re­ sistivity shows ability to differentiate inert and reactive materials and could be a potential candidate for stan­ dardization. The ratio of heat release to calcium hydroxide consumption obtained from the modified R3 test shows a strong correlation with the relative compressive strength of SCMs at different replacement levels and could be used to explore links between reactivity testing, SCM replacement, and paste property evolution.",

The main advantage of this model over conventional systems is that, the additional code required for adding elements to the finite element library is minimal. The powerful mechanisms provided by object oriented systems facilitate this. These mechanisms enable re-use of existing code, and allow the programmer to leave certain operations to the computer, which, without object oriented techniques, would not have been possible. In the above model, the finite elements are represented in the form of a hierarchical tree by which it is possible to develop elements by programming only the differences from existing elements. Suitable object oriented designs have been developed for representing mathematical entities like differential operators and shape functions, with a view to automating the process of development of element properties, so that, the element developer needs to specify just the minimum details, leaving most of the operations to the computer. Some of the concepts in object oriented programming are explained in detail, with the examples used in the above model.",

We represent kinematics variables, such as velocity and rate of strain, as intensive vector-valued forms, while kinetics variables, such as stress and momentum, as extensive covectorvalued pseudo-forms. We treat the spatial, material and convective representations of the motion and show how to geometrically convert from one representation to the other. Furthermore, we show the equivalence of our exterior calculus formulation to standard formulations in the literature based on tensor calculus. In addition, we highlight two types of structures underlying the theory: first, the principal bundle structure relating the space of embeddings to the space of Riemannian metrics on the body and how the latter represents an intrinsic space of deformations and second, the de Rham complex structure relating the spaces of bundle-valued forms to each other.",

In the present report, two series of experiments are reported, one on narrow flange Z-sections and one on wide flange Z-sections. The main objective of the tests was to validate the bifurcation load predictions derived in [1] against experimental values. A further objective of the tests on narrow flange sections was to investigate the change in the direction of overall buckling, as predicted by the theory, from principal axis directions to non-principal directions. A further objective of the tests on wide flange sections was to investigate the possible change of the critical overall buckling mode from a flexural mode to a torsional mode as a result of local buckling. Agreement is generally found between analytical and experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Laminated elastomeric bearings are used widely in both seismic and non-seismic structural engineering applications. The behavior of these bearings under pure loading (compression, shear, or bending) and under combined compression–shear loading has been studied at various levels in previous studies. However, very few studies have considered the behavior of elastomeric bearings under combined loading that includes rotation, and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been no previous study on the effect of rotation on the lateral stability of elastomeric bearings. In bridge applications and some novel seismic isolation applications, e.g., isolation of high-rise buildings and mid-height isolation, it is possible for elastomeric bearings to experience rotation, the effect of which is not well understood. This paper studies the effect of rotation on the horizontal behavior of elastomeric bearings using 3D Finite Element Analysis (FEA). It is observed that constitutive modeling assumptions can have a notable influence on the results, especially at low vertical pressure where the critical shear strain is large. Support rotation does not affect the critical displacement appreciably, but it significantly affects the critical shear force. It is observed that support rotation becomes important for bearings with low second shape factor, even if their first shape factor is large.",

    "abstract": "Linear operators and optimisation are at the core of many algorithms used in signal and image processing, remote sensing, and inverse problems. For small to medium-scale problems, existing software packages (e.g., MATLAB, Python numpy and scipy) allow for explicitly building dense (or sparse) matrices and performing algebraic operations (e.g., computation of matrix-vector products and manipulation of matrices) with syntax that closely represents their corresponding analytical forms. However, many real-application, large-scale operators do not lend themselves to explicit matrix representations, usually forcing practitioners to forego of the convenient linear-algebra syntax available for their explicit-matrix counterparts. PyLops is an open-source Python library providing a flexible and scalable framework for the creation and combination of so-called linear operators, classbased entities that represent matrices and inherit their associated syntax convenience, but do not rely on the creation of explicit matrices. We show that PyLops operators can dramatically reduce the memory load and CPU computations compared to explicit-matrix calculations, while still allowing users to seamlessly use their existing knowledge of compact matrix-based syntax that scales to any problem size because no explicit matrices are required.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the bond behavior of reinforcing bars that are grouted in ducts and subjected to cyclic load. Their behavior has a significant influence on the seismic response of precast concrete frames in which the connections depend on these grouted bars. The critical response quantity is the displacement at the loaded end of the bar caused by inelastic strain penetration into the bonded region. A study was conducted using experimental and analytical methods. In the experimental part of the study, tests were conducted on bars that were grouted over only a short length to develop a constitutive relationship between local bond stress and slip. That relationship was then incorporated into an inelastic, finite element model of the bar. The model was validated by comparing the measured free end displacement of a fully developed bar with the value predicted by analysis. It was then used to conduct a parametric study that extended the investigation beyond the bounds of the matrix of the physical tests. The results of the parametric study were used to develop a simple design equation for predicting the displacement of the loaded end of the bar.",

    "abstract": "The finite element method (FEM) is one of the most commonly used techniques for the solution of partial differential equations on unstructured meshes. This paper discusses both the assembly and the solution phases of the FEM with special attention to the balance of computation and data movement. We present a GPU assembly algorithm that scales to arbitrary degree polynomials used as basis functions, at the expense of redundant computations. We show how the storage of the stiffness matrix affects the performance of both the assembly and the solution. We investigate two approaches: global assembly into the CSR and ELLPACK matrix formats and matrix-free algorithms, and show the trade-off between the amount of indexing data and stiffness data. We discuss the performance of different approaches in light of the implicit caches on Fermi GPUs and show a speedup over a twosocket 12-core CPU of up to 10 times in the assembly and up to 6 times in the solution phase. We present our sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithms that are part of a conjugate gradient iteration and show that a matrix-free approach may be up to two times faster than global assembly approaches and up to 4 times faster than NVIDIA’s cuSPARSE library, depending on the preconditioner used.",

    "abstract": "We depart from a three-dimensional statement of the problem of small bending of elastic plates, for a survey of approximate two-dimensional theories, beginning with Kirchhoff’s fourth-order formulation. After discussing various variational statements of the three-dimensional problem, we describe the development of two-dimensional sixth-order theories by Bolle´, Hencky, Mindlin, and Reissner which take account of the effect of transverse shear deformation. Additionally, we report on an early analysis by Le´vy, on a direct two-dimensional formulation of sixth-order theory, on constitutive coupling of bending and stretching of laminated plates, on higher than sixth-order theories, and on an asymptotic analysis of sixth-order theory which leads to a fourth-order interior solution contribution with first-order transverse shear deformation effects included, as well as to a sequentially determined second-order edge zone solution contribution.",

A general beam theory has been proposed which is applicable to all regular prismatic systems. This has been used to find the appropriate beam-like flexibilities for trusses. The same approach can be used for normal beams, giving values for the shear stiffnesses of various cross-sections as particular results of a general theory embracing torsion, binding, extension and shear of regular prismatic systems.",

The effectsof strainagingon the cyclicbehaviorof reinforcingsteel can be veryrelevant when consideringpostearthquake retrofitting of reinforcedconcrete structures. A series of cyclicuniaxialtests were conducted at the Universityof Canterbury on the two commerciallyavailablegrades of New Zealand reinforcingsteel, where the effects of cyclic loading, bar deformations, strain rate, and strain aging on the stress-strain behavior of reinforcingsteel were investigated.The emphasisof the tests was to observethe materialbehavior, and hence bucklingwas restricted.

    "abstract": "Ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) for elastic response spectra are typically developed at a 5% viscous damping ratio. In reality, however, structural and nonstructural systems can have other damping ratios. This paper develops a new model for a damping scaling factor ( DSF) that can be used to adjust the 5% damped spectral ordinates predicted by a GMPE for damping ratios between 0.5% to 30%. The model is developed based on empirical data from worldwide shallow crustal earthquakes in active tectonic regions. Dependencies of the DSF on potential predictor variables, such as the damping ratio, spectral period, ground motion duration, moment magnitude, source-to-site distance, and site conditions, are examined. The strong influence of duration is captured by the inclusion of both magnitude and distance in the DSF model. Site conditions show weak influence on the DSF. The proposed damping scaling model provides functional forms for the median and logarithmic standard deviation of DSF, and is developed for both RotD50 and GMRotI50 horizontal components. A follow-up paper develops a DSF model for vertical ground motion.",

    "abstract": "A three-dimensional Timoshenko beam is formulated based on the force method and the Hellinger–Reissner variational principle. Material nonlinearities are taken into account by the fiber discretization scheme. The element kinematic is adopted such that makes it appropriate for large displacement analysis, but deformations can only be moderately large. Like the other force-based elements, the proposed beam is first formulated in a basic coordinate system without rigid body motions. Then, the resulted flexibility matrix and resisting force vector are transformed to the global coordinates using a corotational scheme. This finite element analysis is locking-free, because of the exact force interpolation functions. In addition, a 3D extension of the “Curvature and Shear Based Displacement Interpolation” or CSBDI, proposed by Jafari et al., is presented in the paper [10]. To facilitate the numerical implementation of the element, a clear algorithm for state determination of the element is presented. Various numerical examples evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the suggested element.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the work-conjugacy between rotation-dependent moments and finite rotation measures. The methodology adopted consists of writing all the relevant quantities in terms of the rotation vector, using expressions that remain exact in the finite rotation range. Through this procedure, we show how (i) to identify workconjugate (rotation-dependent) moments and rotation measures, (ii) to derive a necessary condition for moment conservativeness and (iii) to obtain the general form of an isotropic conservative rotation-dependent moment. Several moment and finite rotation definitions that have been used in the past are investigated and, in particular, it is shown that the various existing definitions for the so-called semi-tangential moments are distinct in the finite rotation range and that not all of them are conservative. The tangent operator symmetry is discussed in the context of finite element analysis of conservative systems with rotational degrees of freedom, adopting either an additive or a multiplicative update.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear analyses using an updated Lagrangian formulation considering the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory have been developed with consistency in the literature, with different geometric matrices depending on the nonlinear displacement parts considered in the strain tensor. When performing this type of analysis using the Timoshenko beam theory, in general, the stiffness and the geometric matrices present additional degrees of freedom. This work presents a unified approach for the development of a geometric matrix employing the Timoshenko beam theory and considering higher-order terms in the strain tensor. This matrix is obtained using shape functions calculated directly from the solution of the differential equation of the problem. The matrix is implemented in the Ftool software, and its results are compared against several matrices found in the literature, with or without higher-order terms in the strain tensor, as well as the EulerBernoulli or Timoshenko beam theories. Examples show that the use of the Timoshenko beam theory has a strong influence, especially when the structure has small slenderness (short members). For high axial load values, the consideration of higher-order terms in the strain tensor results in larger displacements as expected.",

In order to fill this gap a formulation of the flexural behaviour of thin-walled beams taking into account transverse shear deflections is developed in the present paper. On this basis, the general expression of the shear centre location and the shear deformability tensor for open and closed sections of arbitrary shape are given and their properties discussed. In the case of polygonal, circular and arc-shaped cross sections explicit formulas, which can be suitably implemented for automatic computations, are provided. For the sake of completeness, the expression of the stiffness tensor for prismatic beams, previously obtained by the first two authors in a co-ordinate-free version, is reported. Finally, a numerical example is carried out and comparisons with the results given by Cowper1 for symmetric cross sections are presented.",

    "abstract": "The paper deals with the definition and evaluation of the tangent stiffness of hyperelastic polar shells without drilling rotations. The ambient space for such bodies is a non-linear differentiable manifold. As a consequence the incremental equilibrium must be expressed as the absolute time derivative of the non-linear equilibrium condition expressing the balance between the elastic response and the applied forces. In the absolute time derivative the classical directional derivative is replaced by the covariant derivative according to a fixed connection on the manifold. The evaluation of the tangent stiffness requires us to take the second covariant derivative of the finite deformation measure and this in turn requires an extension of the virtual displacement field in a neighborhood of the given configuration of the shell. It is explicitly shown that different choices of this extension lead to the same tangent stiffness, which is symmetric since the chosen connection is torsionless.",

    "abstract": "Torsion and shear stress fields of a Saint-Venant beam and the relative location of shear and twist centres are investigated for sections of any degree of connectedness. The sliding-torsional compliance tensor of a Timoshenko beam is evaluated by an energy equivalence with Saint-Venant theory. Accordingly, the mutual sliding-torsional term is shown to depend linearly on the relative position of shear and twist centres and the standard definition of shear centre in a Timoshenko beam is found to be coincident with Saint-Venant twist centre. Coincidence of shear and twist centres is assessed for sections with vanishing Poisson ratio and for open, closed and multi-cell thin-walled cross sections. The eigenvalues of the shear factors tensor and the torsion factor are shown to be greater than unity, with the principal directions of shearing and bending compliances non necessarily coincident for non-symmetric cross sections. Numerical examples are developed to provide evidences of the location of the centres and of the principal shearing directions, for non-symmetric L-shaped cross sections with various thickness ratios.",

    "abstract": "Variational integrators are obtained for two mechanical systems whose configuration spaces are, respectively, the rotation group and the unit sphere. In the first case, an integration algorithm is presented for Euler’s equations of the free rigid body, following the ideas of Marsden et al. (Nonlinearity 12:1647–1662, 1999). In the second example, a variational time integrator is formulated for the rigid dumbbell. Both methods are formulated directly on their nonlinear configuration spaces, without using Lagrange multipliers. They are one-step, second order methods which show exact conservation of a discrete angular momentum which is identified in each case. Numerical examples illustrate their properties and compare them with existing integrators of the literature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rotations play a fundamental role in many theories of classical, structural, continuum, and computational mechanics. Their mathematical and computational treatment is delicate because they do not possess the structure of a vector space but, instead, that of a Lie group. For this reason, many of the operations that are often carried out in a straightforward manner in linear spaces have to be re‐examined. In this chapter, we describe the fundamental aspects that need to be dealt with when employing rotations in numerical methods, namely their parameterization, update, interpolation, and linearization of functions on rotations. Additionally, two key applications are presented: the integration of the rigid body equations, and the approximation of the equations of geometrically exact rods.",

But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers–one they are determined to conceal. A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years at university, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. And as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other\"–",

    "abstract": "Performance-based earthquake engineering often requires a large number of sophisticated nonlinear time-history analyses and is therefore demanding both with regard to computing resources and technical expertise. We develop a risk-adaptive statistical learning method based on multi-fidelity analysis that enables engineers to conservatively predict structural response using only low-fidelity analyses such as Pushover analyses. Using a structural model of a 35-story building in California and a training data set consisting of nonlinear time-history and pushover analyses for 160 ground motions, we accurately and conservatively predict maximum story drift ratio, top-story drift ratio, and normalized base shear under the effect of 40 ground motions not seen during the training.",

    "abstract": "Implicit Newmark schemes for integration of finite rotations in structural and continuum mechanics typically are more complicated than those used for translational motion. Using Euler’s representation of the rotation tensor in terms of a rotation vector φ, numerical integration connecting the values {φn, n} and {φn+1, n+1} at the beginning and end of the time step is expressed in terms of an incremental rotation vector θ and the associated incremental rotation tensor (θ). Here, it is shown using backward differentiation that neglecting third order terms in θ, the approximation for the angular velocity ω in terms of θ and its time derivative has the same form as that between velocity and displacement. Consequently, the simplified Newmark scheme in terms of {θ, ω, ω˙ } has the same form as that for updating translations. Details of the Newmark scheme and an analytical expression for the tangent stiffness tensor for the associated Newton–Raphson iteration procedure have been presented for rigid body dynamics. The resulting integration scheme has been tested on a nontrivial problem of three-dimensional motion of a rigid body using a constant time step.

    "abstract": "The general nonlinear Cosserat theory of a rod allows for tangential shear deformation, axial extension and a deformable cross-section. Simplified equations are obtained by introducing kinematic constraints and associated constraint responses which force the cross-section to remain rigid. The equations of motion of this constrained Cosserat rod are shown to be equivalent to those of Antman’s nonlinear special Cosserat theory of a rod. Strain measures motivated by the general Cosserat rod theory are used to develop explicit hyperelastic constitutive equations for the force and moment applied to the rod’s ends.",

    "abstract": "FormWorks-Plus is a generalized public domain user-friendly preprocessor developed to facilitate the process of creating finite element models for structural analysis programs. The lack of a graphical user interface in most academic analysis programs forces users to input the structural model information into the standard text files, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. FormWorks-Plus enables engineers to conveniently set up the finite element model in a graphical environment, eliminating the problems associated with conventional input text files and improving the user’s perception of the application. In this paper, a brief overview of the FormWorks-Plus structure is presented, followed by a detailed explanation of the main features of the program. In addition, demonstration is made of the application of FormWorks-Plus in combination with VecTor programs, advanced nonlinear analysis tools for reinforced concrete structures. Finally, aspects relating to the modelling and analysis of three case studies are discussed: a reinforced concrete beam-column joint, a steel-concrete composite shear wall, and a SFRC shear panel. The unique mixed-type frame-membrane modelling procedure implemented in FormWorks-Plus can address the limitations associated with most frame type analyses.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a numerical multi-scale simulation framework which is extended to accommodate hybrid simulation (numerical-experimental integration). The framework is enhanced with a standardized data exchange format and connected to a generalized controller interface program which facilitates communication with various types of laboratory equipment and testing configurations. A small-scale experimental program was conducted using a six degree-of-freedom hydraulic testing equipment to verify the proposed framework and provide additional data for small-scale testing of shearcritical reinforced concrete structures. The specimens were tested in a multi-axial hybrid simulation manner under a reversed cyclic loading condition simulating earthquake forces. The physical models were 1/3.23-scale representations of a beam and two columns. A mixed-type modelling technique was employed to analyze the remainder of the structures. The hybrid simulation results were compared against those obtained from a large-scale test and finite element analyses. The study found that if precautions are taken in preparing model materials and if the shear-related mechanisms are accurately considered in the numerical model, small-scale hybrid simulations can adequately simulate the behaviour of shear-critical structures. Although the findings of the study are promising, to draw general conclusions additional test data are required.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a framework for multi-platform analysis and hybrid simulation of reinforced concrete (RC) structures. In this approach, each subpart of the structure, based on its mechanical characteristics, is modelled using the most suitable finite element analysis tool or represented with a test specimen. The proposed framework combines all the substructure modules and takes into account the interactions between them by satisfying compatibility and equilibrium requirements. The main contribution of the study lies in demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-platform modelling in accurate and practical analysis of complex RC structures or multidisciplinary RC systems with a particular focus on shear behaviour. Three application examples including a wide-flange shear wall, a three-storey frame with critical joints, and a soil-structure interaction simulation are discussed in detail. It is concluded that the multi-platform analysis can compute the behaviour of such structures with a level of accuracy that was previously difficult to achieve with most single-platform analysis software.",

    "abstract": "The Modified Compression Field Theory (MCFT) was introduced almost 40 years ago as a simple and effective model for calculating the response of reinforced concrete elements under general loading conditions with particular focus on shear. The model was based on a smeared rotating crack concept, and treated cracked reinforced concrete as a new orthotropic material with unique constitutive relationships. An extension of MCFT, known as the Disturbed Stress Field Model (DSFM), was later developed which removed some restrictions and increased the accuracy of the method. The MCFT has been adapted to various types of finite element analysis programs as well as structural design codes. In recent years, the application of the method has been extended to more advanced research areas including extreme loading conditions, stochastic analysis, fiber-reinforced concrete, repaired structures, multiscale analysis, and hybrid simulation. This paper presents a brief overview of the original formulation and its evolvement over the last three decades. In addition, the adaptation of the method to advanced research areas are discussed. It is concluded that the MCFT remains a viable and effective model, whose value lies in its simple yet versatile formulation which enables it to serve as a foundation for accurately solving many diverse and complex problems pertaining to reinforced concrete structures.",

The proposed model captures the bond-slip of reinforcement and shear deformations of the beam-column joint zone to represent the behavior of RC beam-column joints under cyclic loading. The main objective of the present paper is to use the analytical RC frame model to evaluate the influence of joint behavior on the overall performance of RC frames. Comparison of the analytical and test results reveals that the proposed beam-column joint model can reproduce well the fundamental characteristics of non-linear RC beam-column joint behavior.",

The approach is based on the fact that natural frequencies are sensitive indicators of structural integrity. Thus, an analysis of periodical frequency measurements can be used to monitor structural condition. Since frequency measurements can be cheaply acquired, the approach could provide an inexpensive structural assessment technique. The relationships between frequency changes and structural damage are discussed. Various methods proposed for detecting damage using natural frequencies are reviewed.

The underlying generalized-beam theory employed accounts for all coupled significant modes of deformations, including stretching, bending, shear and torsion, as well as warping. Its mixed formulation is of the two-field type, utilizing linear and constant interpolants for displacements and strain fields. Due considerations are given to the effect offinite rotations in space on the non-linear kinematic descriptions as well as the configuration-dependent behaviour of externally applied moment vectors of the conservative and non-conservative types.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is proving to be an efficient alternative approach to classical modeling techniques. AI refers to the branch of computer science that develops machines and software with human-like intelligence. Compared to traditional methods, AI offers advantages to deal with problems associated with uncertainties and is an effective aid to solve such complex problems. In addition, AI-based solutions are good alternatives to determine engineering design parameters when testing is not possible, thus resulting in significant savings in terms of human time and effort spent in experiments. AI is also able to make the process of decision making faster, decrease error rates, and increase computational efficiency. Among the different AI techniques, machine learning (ML), pattern recognition (PR), and deep learning (DL) have recently acquired considerable attention and are establishing themselves as a new class of intelligent methods for use in structural engineering. The objective of this review paper is to summarize techniques concerning applications of the noted AI methods in structural engineering developed over the last decade. First, a general introduction to AI is presented and the importance of AI in structural engineering is described. Thereafter, a review of recent applications of ML, PR, and DL in the field is provided, and the capability of such methods to address the restrictions of conventional models are discussed. Further, the advantages of employing such algorithmic methods are discussed in detail. Finally, potential research avenues and emerging trends for employing ML, PR, and DL are presented, and their limitations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The effect of fire on punching strength of flat slabs is experimentally investigated. An experimental program, consisting of fourteen one-third scale specimens pre-exposed to fire on their tension side and tested under concentric punching, is carried out. The main investigated parameters are the duration of exposure to fire, the concrete cover and the cooling method. Specimens are subjected to direct flame for 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 h, respectively. Concrete covers of 25 mm and 10 mm are used for test specimens. Two cooling methods are employed; gradual cooling in air and sudden cooling with water applied directly to the heated surface of the slabs. It was found that exposure of slabs to fire resulted in a reduction of up to 18.3% and 43% in cracking loads and ultimate punching loads, respectively. Concrete cover was proven to have a significant effect on level of temperature in tension reinforcement. A reduction in punching strength of up to 14% was observed for specimens with 3 h exposure to fire compared to those with one hour exposure. Sudden cooling was found to reduce punching strength by 25% compared to specimens gradually cooled. A simplified mechanical model for calculating fire effect on punching capacity is proposed and found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Partial Differential Equations (PDE) are fundamental to model different phenomena in science and engineering mathematically. Solving them is a crucial step towards a precise knowledge of the behaviour of natural and engineered systems. In general, in order to solve PDEs that represent real systems to an acceptable degree, analytical methods are usually not enough. One has to resort to discretization methods. For engineering problems, probably the best known option is the finite element method (FEM). However, powerful alternatives such as mesh-free methods and Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) are also available. The fundamental idea is to approximate the solution of the PDE by means of functions specifically built to have some desirable properties. In this contribution, we explore Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as an option for approximation. They have shown impressive results in areas such as visual recognition. DNNs are regarded here as function approximation machines. There is great flexibility to define their structure and important advances in the architecture and the efficiency of the algorithms to implement them make DNNs a very interesting alternative to approximate the solution of a PDE. We concentrate in applications that have an interest for Computational Mechanics. Most contributions that have decided to explore this possibility have adopted a collocation strategy. In this contribution, we concentrate in mechanical problems and analyze the energetic format of the PDE. The energy of a mechanical system seems to be the natural loss function for a machine learning method to approach a mechanical problem. As proofs of concept, we deal with several problems and explore the capabilities of the method for applications in engineering.",

    "abstract": "Here we present a general framework for learning simulation, and provide a single model implementation that yields state-of-the-art performance across a variety of challenging physical domains, involving fluids, rigid solids, and deformable materials interacting with one another. Our framework—which we term “Graph Network-based Simulators” (GNS)—represents the state of a physical system with particles, expressed as nodes in a graph, and computes dynamics via learned message-passing. Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework is the most accurate general-purpose learned physics simulator to date, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two alternative nonlinear finite element formulations emanating from the Simo‐Reissner beam theory are considered. The orientation of the beam cross section is characterised by a director frame which can be either represented by means of rotational parameters or the direction cosine matrix. In the planar case the use of a single angle can be considered as the canonical formulation. The corresponding finite element approximation relies on the interpolation of the nodal angles. However, the extension of this approach to the three‐dimensional case is nontrivial and often leads to element formulations beeing not frame‐indifferent. On the other hand, the interpolation of the nodal direction cosines in general yields frame‐indifferent element formulations [1, 2]. The present talk focuses on a comparison of the two aforementioned finite element beam formulations for planar problems. (© 2006 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)",

    "abstract": "Structural members yielding in shear are used in earthquake resistant systems, such as eccentrically braced steel frames and systems with passive energy dissipation devices, in a conscious effort to concentrate the energy dissipation capacity of the structure in components that can be repaired or replaced after a major earthquake. The simulation of the energy dissipation capacity of these components is important in the evaluation of the seismic response of these structural systems. This paper presents a new beam element for the simulation of the hysteretic behavior of shear-yielding members. The element is based on a three-field variational formulation with independent force, displacement and deformation fields. The displacement field is based on Timoshenko’s shear beam theory. The nonlinear response of the element arises from the integration of biaxial stress-strain relations over several control sections along the element length. The biaxial material model accounts for the interaction between normal and shear stress. While previous concentrated plasticity models involve parameter tuning for different loading and support conditions, the proposed model is general in its derivation of the axial force-shear-flexure interaction from the material response. The proposed model shows the characteristic advantages of force-based beam elements and is capable of simulating the inelastic response of short beams with a single element without suffering from shear locking. The effect of shear is significant in these members during the elastic and inelastic response. The ability of the model to accurately represent the hysteretic behavior of short shear-yielding members is ascertained with correlation studies of analytical results with available experimental data from shear-link experiments.",

The model is based on a three-field variational formulation with independent displacement, stress, and strain fields. The displacement field is based on the Timoshenko beam theory.

With the derivation of the axial force-shear-flexure interaction of short members from the material response the proposed model is general, in contrast to existing concentrated plasticity models that require parameter calibration for different loading and support conditions. Furthermore, the model does not suffer from shear locking and does not require mesh refinement for the accurate representation of inelastic member deformations. Correlation studies of analytical results with available experimental data of the hysteretic behavior of shear-yielding members confirm the capabilities of the proposed model. Its computational efficiency makes it suitable for large scale simulations of the earthquake response of structures with shear-yielding members.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for the integration of a class of plastic-damage material models. The integration of the evolution equations results in a nonlinear problem, which is linearized and solved with the Newton–Raphson method using a sub-stepping strategy. The consistent tangent matrix can be formulated either in terms of the stress components in a general reference system or in terms of the principal stress and strain components with the former then transformed to the general reference system. In order to account for plane stress conditions, the stress–strain relations of the 3d material model are then condensed out. Plane stress conditions are imposed by the linearization of the stresses that need to be set equal to zero; thus the strain fields are updated in the corresponding directions. This solution method is extended to include transverse pressure and the effect of transverse reinforcing steel for a 3d concrete material model. The equilibrium of the stresses in the reinforcing steel and concrete is linearized and the strain fields are updated until the residual satisfies a specified tolerance. The consistent tangent matrix due to the condensation process is derived. The proposed algorithms are tested at the material and element level by comparison of numerical solutions with available experimental data.",

    "abstract": "In the traditional optimization algorithms, constraints are satisfied within a tolerance defined by a crisp number. In actual engineering practice, constraint evaluation involves many sources of imprecision and approximation. When an optimization algorithm is forced to satisfy the design constraints exactly, it can miss the global optimum solution within the confine of commonly acceptable approximations. Extending the augmented Lagrangian genetic algorithm (GA) of Adeli and Cheng, a fuzzy augmented Lagrangian GA is presented for optimization of steel structures subjected to the constraints of the AISC allowable stress design specifications taking into account the fuzziness in the constraints. The membership function for the fuzzy domain is found by the intersection of the fuzzy membership function for the objective function and the constraints using the maxmin procedure of Bellman and Zadeh. Nonlinear quadratic fuzzy membership functions are used for objective function and constraints. The algorithm is applied to two space axial-load structures including a large 37-story structure with 1,310 members. The features and advantages of the new fuzzy GA include acknowledging the imprecision and fuzziness in the code-based design constraints, increased likelihood of obtaining the global optimum solution, improved convergence, and reduced total computer processing time.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the continuing evolution of the Open-source Framework for Experimental Setup and Control (OpenFresco), an object oriented, environment independent software framework that can be utilized to couple any number of finite element analysis software packages in a modular and highly structured manner. The exchange of data between the coupled codes takes place through the connection of OpenFresco with special adapter elements, which are added to the finite element applications using their programming interface. An adapter element provides a versatile and computationally efficient method for coupling several finite element (FE) analysis programs so that the unique modeling and analysis capabilities of each can be utilized simultaneously in the simulation of a complete system. This approach provides the important advantage that all of the connected codes run continuously without the need to shutdown and restart, decreasing analysis time consumptions significantly. Speed of coupled simulations where one or more FE-software codes are used together, including cases where physical substructures are incorporated in the FE model for a hybrid test, are at least an order of magnitude faster than conventional approaches relying on shutting down and restarting the analysis in the coupled programs at each integration time step. The implementation and accuracy of this novel FE-software coupling are demonstrated using a dynamic analysis of a structural model from earthquake engineering.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an analytical study on the effect of panel zone (PZ) distortions on momentresisting steel frame behavior. Analytical frame models were developed to study the influence of PZ distortions on frames with hinging beam and hinging column joints. A simple, trilinear analytical model was developed based on the mechanics of the column web and the flanges at the beam-column joint. Two bilinear rotational springs were needed at each joint to accurately simulate PZ distortions. Results suggest that simple analytical models that do not include PZ distortions underestimate the elastic drift and overestimate the base shear capacity for moment-resisting steel frames. Further, simple analytical models used to determine inelastic seismic behavior may underestimate the rotational ductility for beam-column joints.",

In both theories groups operating in the infinitesimal played a crucial role. To judge from his publications in 1922–24, Cartan developed his concept of generalized spaces with the dual context of general relativity and non-standard elasticity in mind. In this context it seemed natural to express the translational curvature of his new spaces by a rotational quantity (via a kind of Grassmann dualization). So Cartan called his translational curvature “torsion” and coupled it to a hypothetical rotational momentum of matter several years before spin was encountered in quantum mechanics.",

A method for calculating shear deformation coefficients is developed by combining the engineering beam theory with an elasticity solution for a cantilever beam under a tip load. These coefficients can be found by a geometric approach or an energy method. The latter gives a symmetric tensor of shear deformation coefficients and is more accurate. A new general beam stiffness matrix which accounts for both bending and shear deflection is derived. Numerical examples are presented to show the influence of the Poisson’s ratio and the choice of coordinate axes on the shear deformation coefficients.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a spatial Timoshenko beam element with a total Lagrangian formulation. The element is based on curvature interpolation that is independent of the rigid-body motion of the beam element and simpliÿes the formulation. The section response is derived from plane section kinematics. A two-node beam element with constant curvature is relatively simple to formulate and exhibits excellent numerical convergence. The formulation is extended to N -node elements with polynomial curvature interpolation. Models with moderate discretization yield results of su cient accuracy with a small number of iterations at each load step. Generalized second-order stress resultants are identiÿed and the section response takes into account non-linear material behaviour. Green–Lagrange strains are expressed in terms of section curvature and shear distortion, whose ÿrst and second variations are functions of node displacements and rotations. A symmetric tangent sti ness matrix is derived by consistent linearization and an iterative acceleration method is used to improve numerical convergence for hyperelastic materials. The comparison of analytical results with numerical simulations in the literature demonstrates the consistency, accuracy and superior numerical performance of the proposed element.

Results presented include an assessment of the effect of eccentricity of load, strain rate, amount and distribution of longitudinal steel, and amont and distribution of transverse steel. A stress-strain curve for concrete confined by hoop reinforcement and loaded at a high strain rate (comparable with seismic loading) is proposed and compared with an wisting curve based on previous tests conducted at low strain rates. The available ultimate compressive strain for concrete confined by hoop reinforcement is also discussed.",

The exact response sensitivity of material nonlinear beam–column elements is derived for the displacement- and force-based formulations. For displacement-based beam–column elements the response sensitivity is straightforward to compute because the displacement field is specified along the element. A new approach is presented for computing the response sensitivity of force-based beam–column elements, in which the displacement field is not specified. In this approach, the response sensitivity depends on the derivative of unbalanced section forces because the element displacement field changes with the element state. Example nonlinear static analyses of steel and reinforced concrete structural systems verify the exact response sensitivity for force-based elements using the new approach.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient response gradient computations for nonlinear geometry are required in structural reliability, optimization, system identification, and response sensitivity analysis of frame structures that undergo large displacements. In this paper, the exact response gradient of beam-column finite elements under large displacements is derived considering uncertain material and geometric parameters. The element response formulation takes place in a corotational reference frame that displaces and rotates with the element, thus permitting the separation of nonlinear material from nonlinear geometric effects in the computation of the response, as well as of the gradient of the response. Relative to the corotational reference frame, small deformation theory suffices for all structural engineering applications. Thus, the proposed response gradient computations are applicable to most beam-column element formulations available in the literature, including force-based and mixed formulations.",

    "abstract": "The finite-element software framework OpenSees is extended with parameter updating and response sensitivity capabilities to support client applications such as reliability, optimization, and system identification. Using software design patterns, member properties, applied loadings, and nodal coordinates can be identified and repeatedly updated in order to create customized finite-element model updating applications. Parameters are identified using a Chain of Responsibility software pattern, where objects in the finite-element model forward a parameterization request to component objects until the request is handled. All messages to identify and update parameters are passed through a Facade that decouples client applications from the finite-element domain of OpenSees. To support response sensitivity analysis, the Strategy design pattern facilitates multiple approaches to evaluate gradients of the structural response, whereas the Visitor pattern ensures that objects in the finite-element domain make the proper contributions to the equations that govern the response sensitivity. Examples demonstrate the software design and the steps taken by representative finite-element model updating and response sensitivity applications.",

The implementation of a beam-column finite element is reduced to the state determination procedure for a basic system that displaces and rotates with the element. An abstraction for geometric nonlinearity represents the kinematic and equilibrium transformations between the basic and global reference systems, while an abstraction for force-deformation response represents material nonlinearity for the basic system. Separate objects encapsulate material stress-strain behavior and cross-sectional integration in order to increase the modeling flexibility for computing the response of fiber-discretized cross sections. Multiple forms of distributed plasticity in beam-column elements are incorporated in the framework through objects that encapsulate one-dimensional quadrature rules. Software design patterns are utilized to create complex beam-column simulation models by composition of basic building blocks. The modeling flexibility of the software design is demonstrated through the simulation of a reinforced concrete column.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent literature shows the choice of an integration method in the state determination of force‐based frame finite elements has a significant influence on the computed element response. To assess the modeling uncertainty associated with integration methods in force‐based elements, analytical sensitivity of one‐dimensional interpolatory quadrature is developed via direct differentiation of the governing Vandermonde equations. Comparisons with finite difference calculations show that the combination of the Vandermonde equation sensitivity with equations that govern force‐based element response sensitivity leads to an accurate approach to stand‐alone response sensitivity analysis. Consistent with previous findings for material, load, and geometric parameters in finite element response sensitivity analysis, sensitivity with respect to parameters associated with the integration method in force‐based elements improves the efficiency of gradient‐based algorithms where the locations and/or weights of the integration method are treated as uncertain random variables.

    "abstract": "The direct differentiation method (DDM) has been shown to be an accurate and efficient approach to computing the sensitivity of structural response to uncertain parameters of constitutive models and finite-element formulations. Although it is well-known that the DDM should be consistent with the numerical time stepping procedure at the structural level, it is possible for element-level numerical instabilities to arise when the response sensitivity equations are inconsistent with the equations that govern the element response. Two existing formulations of DDM force-based element response sensitivity are shown to be mathematically equivalent in exact arithmetic; however, only one is consistent with the force-based response equations and possesses a low condition number for finite arithmetic. On the other hand, the inconsistent formulation has a high condition number that is equal to the product of the largest singular values of the section and element stiffness matrices. Representative examples show that the high condition number of the inconsistent formulation is innocuous for sensitivity with respect to section-level parameters but can lead to round off errors for sensitivity with respect to element-level geometric parameters.

The equivalence of energetic and kinematic shear factors stems as an immediate consequence of the equivalence of shear compliance tensors.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of near and far fault ground motion on the seismic behavior of historical arch bridges through a combined numerical and experimental evaluation. The approach undertaken begins with finite element modeling of the arch bridge and identification of the most significant vibration modes of the bridge through ambient vibration testing. Uncertain parameters of the finite element model are then revised through systematic comparisons of the measured vibration models to those that are predicted by the model. The revised finite element model is used to predict the time history response for displacements and stresses through which the effect of the finite element model updating on model predictions are evaluated. Furthermore, displacements and stresses obtained considering both near and far fault ground motions are then compared. Results indicate that near fault ground motion imposes higher seismic demand on the arch bridge observed in both higher displacements and stresses.",

    "abstract": "The rehabilitation of existing buildings requires an assessment of their lateral load resisting capacity which may be limited by the strength and ductility capacity of their critical regions. From this assessment, a rehabilitation strategy can be formulated. Lack of adequate confinement and shear reinforcement in the beam-column joints of existing reinforced concrete frames may be the cause of brittle failure during a seismic event. Most of the analysis programs assume infinitely rigid beam-column joints in concrete frames regardless of the reinforcement detail. In this paper a beam-column joint element in OpenSees software platform verified with experimental result and then the response of five and ten story existing frames with beam-column joint elements subjected to dynamic and static loading was compared with the response of frames with rigid joint assumption. The results show that the modelling of inelastic shear deformation in joints has a significant effect on the seismic response in terms of drift and damage. The rigid joint assumption was found to be inappropriate when assessing the behaviour of existing non-ductile structures.",

    "abstract": "The ordinary beams theory based on Bernoulli’s theorem is not applicable to non linear and non prismatic members, in RC structures like deep beams, pile caps, dapped ended beams and corbels etc. Such structures normally fail due to shear failure rather than flexural failure and cannot be analyzed and designed with the flexural analysis or beam theory. Strut and Tie Model (STM) provides an acceptable analysis and design solution for the non linear and disturbed regions in RC structures. In this research four pile caps, six corbels, three deep beams, and three dapped ended beams, designed on the basis of assumed Strut and Tie Model were tested in the laboratory under monotonic loads. The failure loads were compared with the assumed design loads. It has been observed that STM provides reasonable solution for the design of disturbed region in RC structures. In most of the cases the actual failure loads were reasonably closed to the theoretical design loads. However for generalization of the STM as an alternative design solution, more experimental work is required on non linear and disturbed region.",

In the direct approach, nonlinear soil and foundation behaviors are explicitly included in the global model to account for geotechnical and structural behavior of the pile foundation. The computational effort required for the direct analysis is very high and not economical in some cases. The substructural approach divides the system into two subsystems, a superstructure which includes the bridge columns, bridge deck and bridge abutments and a substructure which includes the pile foundation and the surrounding soil media. The substructure is approach is more efficient.",

    "abstract": "A global three-dimensional finite-element model was developed for the seismically instrumented Painter Street Overpass. This model included elements to simulate nonlinear foundation-soil interaction and key structure foundation details. A complete system or direct approach was used in the model, which has the advantage of implementing either material or geometric nonlinearity for soil-foundation supports. In dynamic analyses, the model was excited using the free-field, three-component record of the 1992 Cape Mendocino/Petrolia earthquake. The soil-structure interaction model parameters were based on actual engineering soil properties obtained from in-situ field and laboratory tests conducted during a geotechnical field investigation at the abutments. The results of the analyses show that the proposed model can represent fairly well the seismic response of the Painter Street Overpass and that the modelling of the pile foundations at the bent had much less of an impact on the overall bridge response as compared to the abutments. Vertical pile-soil interaction at any of the three bridge supports did not affect the results significantly and may be represented by simple linear springs in similar bridge evaluations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the general, two-dimensional formulation for the response of free-standing rigid bodies to base excitation. The formulation assumes rigid body, rigid foundation, and Coulomb friction. The behavior is described in terms of the five possible modes of response (rest, slide, rock, slide-rock, and freeflight) and impact between the body and foundation. The governing equations of motion are summarized for the modes: slide, rock, and slide-rock. Approximate equations are outlined for the rock and slide-rock modes that are valid for small angles of rotation. A model governing impact from a rock, slide-rock or free-flight mode is derived from first principles using classical impact theory. This model assumes a point-impact, nonzero coefficient of restitution and finite value of friction. The paper presents a complete and consistent formulation, which can be used in its entirety or in part, for investigation of the generalized response using suitable analytical or numerical techniques.",

    "abstract": "The motion of a plane rigid body that rests unrestrained on a rigid foundation that is accelerating is described by five modes of response: rest, slide, rock, slide-rock, and free flight. Determining the correct initial mode of response is essential to the analysis of the generalized behavior. In the past it has been generally assumed that only a slide or rock mode can be initiated from rest. It is demonstrated in the present paper that a slide-rock mode can also be initiated from rest. Criteria governing the initiation of the slide, rock, and sliderock modes are derived. Results show that it is incorrect to assume that a rock mode ensues if static friction is simply greater than the width-to-height ratio of the body; a slide-rock mode is initiated when friction is greater than the width-to-height ratio, but less than a critical value that is a function of the ground acceleration. The friction required to initiate a rock mode increases with ground acceleration, as would be expected. The results demonstrate a more natural transition of the governing mode of response, from sliding to slide-rock and finally to pure rocking, as friction is increased for a given foundation acceleration. The analysis is restricted to a rectangular block, assuming Coulomb friction and horizontal ground acceleration.",

However, there are lots of obstacles to apply these techniques to actual bridge projects. In this paper, extensible information schema for bridges is proposed to enable interoperability between different design and construction processes. From the planning stage of a bridge construction project to the construction stage, the proposed bridge information models were applied to enhance current practices. Digital mock-up, parametric modeling, 4D and 5D simulation were conducted. From several applications for four years, a design guideline of 3D information models was suggested. It is essential to change current processes for the effective use of BIM techniques in bridge construction industry.",

Unlike traditional approaches, a Galerkin spatial discretization of the equations of motion, now referred to the inertial frame, yields the standard form of nonlinear structural dynamics: Mq¨ + Dq˙ + P(q) = F, with M and D constant matrices. Numerical examples that involve finite vibrations coupled with large overall motions are presented. These simulations also demonstrate the capability of the present formulation in handling multibody dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic response of a flexible beam subject to large overall motions is traditionally formulated relative to a floating frame, sometimes referred to as the shadow beam. This type of formulation leads to equations of motion of the form g˜(y˙, y, t) = 0, that are implicit, nonlinear and highly coupled in the inertia terms. An alternative approach is proposed whereby all quantities are referred to the inertial frame. As a result, the inertia term enters linearly in the formulation simply as mass times acceleration. Crucial to this formulation is the use of finite strain rod theories capable of treating finite rotations. Numerical examples that involve finite vibrations coupled with large overall motions are presented in Part II of this paper.",

Enforcement of the consistency condition is shown to reduce to the solution of a simple nonlinear equation. Consistent elastoplastic tangent moduli are obtained by exact linearization of the algorithm. Use of these moduli is essential in order to preserve the asymptotic rate of quadratic convergence of Newton methods. The accuracy of the algorithm is assessed by means of iso-error maps. The excellent performance of the algorithm for large time steps is illustrated in numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "A three-field mixed formulation in terms of displacements,stresses and an enhanced strain field is presented which encompasses, as a particular case, the classical method of incompatible modes. Within this framework, incompatible elements arise as particular ’compatible’ mixed approximations of the enhanced strain field. The conditions that the stress interpolation contain piece-wise constant functions and be L,-orthsgonal to the enhanced strain interpolation,ensure satisfaction of the patch test and allow the elimination of the stress field from the formulation. The preceding conditions are formulated in a form particularly convenient for element design. As an illustration of the methodology three new elements are developed and shown to exhibit good performance: a plane 3D elastic/plasticQUAD, an axisymmetric element and a thick plate bending QUAD. The formulation described herein is suitable for non-linear analysis.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops and applies the energy—momentum method to the problem of nonlinear stability of relative equilibria. The method is applied in detail to the stability analysis of uniformly rotating states of geometrically exact rod models, and a rigid body with an attached flexible appendage. Here, the flexible appendage is modeled as a geometrically exact rod capable of accommodating arbitrarily large deformations in three dimensions; including extension, shear, flexure and twist. The model is said to be “geometrically exact” because of the lack of restrictions of the allowable deformations, and the full invariance properties of the model under superposed rigid body motions. We show that a (sharp) necessary condition for nonlinear stability is that the whole assemblage be in uniform (stationary) rotation about the shortest axis of a precisely defined “locked” inertia dyadic. Sufficient conditions are obtained by appending the restriction that the angular velocity of the stationary motion be bounded from above by the square root ofthe minimum eigenvalue of an associated linear operator. Specific examples are worked out, including the case of a rod attached to a rigid body in uniform rotation. Our technique depends crucially on a special choice of variables, introduced in this paper and referred to as the block diagonalization procedure, in which the second variation of the energy augmented with the linear and angular momentum block diagonalizes, separating the rotational from the internal vibration modes.",

The underlying variational formulation of the model is discussed, and computational procedures employing a Galerkin projection are addressed.

    "abstract": "We show that, for rigid body dynamics, the mid-point rule formulated in body co-ordinates exactly conserves energy and the norm of the angular momentum for incremental force-free motions, but fails to conserve the direction of the angular momentum vector. Further, we show that the mid-point rule formulated in the spatial representation is, in general, physically and geometrically meaningless. An alternative algorithm is developed which exactly preserves energy, and the total spatial angular momentum in incremental force-free motions. The implicit version of this algorithm is unconditionally stable and second order accurate. The explicit version conserves exactly angular momentum in incremental force-free motions. Numerical simulations are presented which illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed procedure, even for incremental rotations over 65 degrees. The procedure is directly applicable to transient dynamic calculations of geometrically exact rods and shells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A numerical time‐integration scheme for the dynamics of non‐linear elastic shells is presented that simultaneously and independent of the time‐step size inherits exactly the conservation laws of total linear, total angular momentum as well as total energy. The proposed technique generalizes to non‐linear shells recent work of the authors on non‐linear elastodynamics and is ideally suited for long‐term/large‐scale simulations. The algorithm is second‐order accurate and can be immediately extended with no modification to a fourth‐order accurate scheme. The property of exact energy conservation induces a strong notion of non‐linear numerical stability which manifests itself in actual simulations. The superior performance of the proposed scheme method relative to conventional time‐integrators is demonstrated in numerical simulations exhibiting large strains coupled with a large overall rigid motion. These numerical experiments show that symplectic schemes often regarded as unconditionally stable, such as the mid‐point rule, can exhibit a dramatic blow‐up in finite time while the present method remains perfectly stable.",

    "abstract": "It is shown that conventional symplectic algorithms do not, in general, retain their symplectic character when the symplectic two{form is non{constant. More importantly, it is shown that implicit symplectic schemes are not suitable for the numerical integration of sti systems possessing high frequency contents. The presence of multiple roots on the unit circle at in nite sampling frequencies leads, inevitably, to eventual blow-up of the scheme if the high frequencies are not resolved. In sharp contrast with symplectic integrators, algorithms designed to simultaneously preserve the total momentum and the energy of the system are shown to be free from these shortcomings. Speci cally, for sti systems, the unresolved high-frequencies are shown to be controlled by property of exact energy conservation without resorting to high-frequency numerical dissipation. A general technique for the construction of exact energy{momentum algorithms is described within the context of the N-body problem.",

    "abstract": "This paper summarizes some recent results on symplectic and energy-momentum conserving time-stepping algorithms for Hamiltonian systems in nonlinear solid mechanics. To motivate conserving schemes a numerical example is provided in which a typical symplectic method is shown to exhibit blow-up, i.e., instability. Some new analytical results on the observed instability are then brie y presented. In particular, results are presented which show that within the context of a simple model problem the implicit mid-point rule (the prototypical symplectic implicit Runge-Kutta method) is only conditionally stable while a conserving scheme is unconditionally (spectrally) stable. An example is then given which shows that the approach used to construct the conserving algorithm for the model problem generalizes to more complex systems such as nonlinear elastodynamics. With regard to higher-order conserving schemes, a method by which fourth-order accuracy may be obtained from a large class of second-order schemes is summarized.",

During large events, particularly seismic events, the buildings may experience buckling of these bracing elements. Capturing the behavior of individual braces to buckling is critically important if one is to determine the response of such buildings to large magnitude events. This educational application is intended to educate users on how braced frames should be modeled when performing numerical simulations of the entire building. This application will allow the user to explore how different modeling assumptions effect the response of a braced frame element and how the simulated response compares with actual experimental data. Allowing the user to validate their modeling assumptions is critically important for the user to gain competence in this area, as just producing hysteresis loops that look meaningful can be dangerously misleading.",

    "abstract": "This research focuses on the geometrically nonlinear large deflection analysis of a cantilever beam subjected to a concentrated tip load. Initially, a step-by-step development of the theoretical solution is provided and is compared with numerical analysis based on beam and shell elements. It is shown that the large deflections predicted by numerical analysis using beam elements accurately capture the theoretical results as compared to shell elements. Comparison of above deflections with theoretical and numerical approaches based on small deflection theory is also provided to show the extent of latter’s applicability. Finally, it is shown that for a linear elastic working range of common engineering metals, both small and large deflection approaches yield same results and one can adopt the simple small deflection approach for engineering design. It is highlighted that the theoretical approach of large deflection commonly available in design texts is valid only within the linear elastic strain limit and recommends a careful approach to designers. Further, the effect of parametric variation in geometry and stiffness of beam on large deflection, and resulting bending strains and tip reactions are analyzed and discussed.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of wireless sensor network (WSN) for continuous seismic monitoring system of cable-stayed bridge is presented in this paper. A newly developed WSN that is based on simultaneous high-speed concurrent transmission flooding technique was implemented on the Shin-Nakagawa Bridge, a 530-m single-plane, single-pylon, steel box girder, cable-stayed bridge in Ibaraki prefecture, eastern Japan. The structure is seismically isolated with laminated rubber bearings at the main pylon and piers. Some isolation bearings were partially damaged by the 2011 Great East Japan (Tohoku) earthquake. As a part of monitoring, a WSN with a total of 26 sensor nodes were installed at several locations on the piers, main pylon, girder, and ground. This paper describes the WSN system, the monitoring scheme and procedure, analysis of recorded seismic responses, and their use for structural assessment, especially the performance of isolation bearings during earthquakes. The monitoring system successfully recorded structural responses from 63 earthquakes in the 45 months monitoring period between August 2017 to December 2020, which include the responses from near-field and far-field earthquakes. The comparisons of recorded ground motions with existing nearby seismograph have shown the accuracy and reliability of the WSN. Modal parameters of the bridge were successfully determined from the seismic responses obtained from the WSN using multi-input multi-output time-domain system identifications. Characteristics of seismically isolated bridge responses, such as high-frequency filtering effect and decoupling effect of the girder responses, can be clearly observed from the records of the large earthquakes.

This paper presents the development of a versatile smooth hysteretic model based on internal variables, with stiffness and strength deterioration and with pinching characteristics. The theoretical background, development, and implementation of the model are discussed. Examples are shown to illustrate the features of the model. Many inelastic constitutive models in popular use have been developed independently of each other based on different behavioral, physical, or mathematical motivations. This paper attempts to unify the concepts underlying such models. Such a holistic understanding is essential to realize limitations in application of inelastic models and to extend 1D models to 3D models featuring interaction between various stress resultants.",

    "abstract": "The heat transfer problem is often considered to be the kernel of a fire resistance analysis. In fact, one- or two-dimensional closedform solutions have long laid the foundation for an engineer’s understanding of the temperature distribution within a structural element exposed to fire. Although many closed-form solutions of the thermal problems for structural members in buildings exist, the literature is surprisingly thin for bridge structures—and even more so for suspension bridge structures. This paper addresses that sparsity by presenting a generalized approach for the formulation and solution of the heat transfer problem for a suspension bridge main cable exposed—either partially or completely—to fire. The approach first normalizes and then nondimensionalizes the problem. It then divides the resulting generalized time-dependent heat equation with spatially dependent boundary conditions into a steady-state and transient problem and subsequently solves each piece with a classic separation of variables technique. The functionality of the solution is assessed by performing both an error analysis and a computational time comparison with numerical results for three verification problems.

    "abstract": "The entirely general nonlinear theory of rods is developed. Two vector equilibrium equations, valid on the rod axis are derived exactly, by direct integration of the mechanical balance laws of continuum mechanics over the rod cross section. Then the energetically conjugate exact 6-®eld kinematics of the rod axis is implied in an integral identity, which expresses the principle of the virtual work. The kinematics consists of the displacement vector of the axis, describing the average translation, and the proper orthogonal tensor, representing the average rotation of the cross section. The integral identity also suggests the required general form of the constitutive relations. They are already approximate from the physical side, are then the best place to make geometric approximations and abbreviations to a certain constrained theory. The constitutive relations, the only nonexact segment of the theory, are treated here as an interchangeable element, supplementing the exactly formulated principle of virtual work.",

    "abstract": "This work presents the development of a hysteretic beam element in the context of the finite element method, that is suitable for the inelastic dynamic analysis of framed structures. The formulation proposed is able to capture the main characteristics of hysteresis in structural systems and mainly accounts for stiffness degradation, strength deterioration and pinching phenomena, as well as for non-symmetrical yielding that often characterizes their behavior. The proposed formulation is based on the decoupling of deformations into elastic and hysteretic parts by considering additional hysteretic degrees of freedom, i.e., the hysteretic curvatures and hysteretic axial deformations. The direct stiffness method is employed to establish global matrices and determine the mass and viscous damping, as well as the elastic stiffness and the hysteretic matrix of the structure that corresponds to the newly added hysteretic degrees of freedom. All the governing equations of the structure, namely the linear global equations of motion and the nonlinear evolution equations at elemental level that account for degradations and pinching, are solved simultaneously. This is accomplished by converting the system of equations into state space form and implementing a variable-order solver based on numerical differentiation formulas (NDFs) to determine the solution. Furthermore, hysteretic loops and degradation phenomena are easily controlled by modifying the model parameters at the element level enabling simulations of a more realistic response. Numerical results are presented and compared against experimental results and other finite element codes to validate the proposed formulation and verify its ability to simulate complex hysteretic behavior exhibiting cyclic degradations.",

Its influence has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the fields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difficult to understand and to use.",

Some important numerical and theoretical aspects leading to a computationally efficient strategy were obtained. For instance, the formulation leads to invariant equilibrium equations under rigid body motions and a locking free element. In this paper we discuss some important aspects of this formulation. The invariance property of the equilibrium equations under rigid body motions is discussed and brought out in simple analytical examples. The discretization method based on the exponential map is recalled and a geometric interpretation is given. Special attention is also dedicated to the consistent interpolation of the velocities.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a dynamic formulation of a straight beam finite element in the setting of the special Euclidean group SEð3Þ. First, the static and dynamic equilibrium equations are derived in this framework from variational principles. Then, a non-linear interpolation formula using the exponential map is introduced. It is shown that this framework leads to a natural coupling in the interpolation of the position and rotation variables. Next, the discretized internal and inertia forces are developed. The semi-discrete equations of motion take the form of a second-order ordinary differential equation on a Lie group, which is solved using a Lie group time integration scheme. It is remarkable that no parameterization of the nodal variables needs to be introduced and that the proposed Lie group framework leads to a compact and easy-to-implement formulation. Some important numerical and theoretical aspects leading to a computationally efficient strategy are highlighted and discussed. For instance, the formulation leads to invariant tangent stiffness and mass matrices under rigid body motions and a locking free element. The proposed formulation is successfully tested in several numerical static and dynamic examples.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a fibre beam–column element for the non-linear static and dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete frames. It is assumed that plane sections remain plane and normal to the longitudinal axis. The effects of shear and bond-slip are, thus, presently neglected. The non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the element derives from the constitutive relations of concrete and reinforcing steel fibres into which each section is divided. The element formulation is flexibility-based and relies on force interpolation functions that strictly satisfy the equilibrium of bending moments and axial force along the element. Since the element does not make use of displacement interpolation functions, an iterative algorithm is needed for the determination of the resisting forces during the element state determination. The proposed algorithm is accurate and stable, even in the presence of strength loss, and is, thus, capable of tracing very well the highly non-linear behaviour of R/C members under cyclic load combinations of bending moment and axial force.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that beam finite elements that enforce equilibrium rather than compatibility along the element are better suited for the description of the nonlinear behavior of frame elements. This is particularly true for elements that exhibit loss of strength and stiffness under monotonic and cyclic loads. Existing formulations, however, fail to define a consistent way of implementing the force method in the context of imposed kinematic, rather than static, boundary conditions, as is the case for element models in a standard finite element program. This paper derives the general formulation of a beam finite element from a mixed approach which points the way to the consistent numerical implementation of the element state determination in the context of a standard finite element program. The element state determination centers on a new iterative solution algorithm that is based on residual deformations rather than residual forces at the section and element level. Equilibrium is enforced in a strict sense along the element, while the section constitutive relation is satisfied within a specified tolerance when the algorithm converges, The proposed algorithm is general and can be used with any section constitutive relation.",

    "abstract": "From the mechanical point of view, the particularity of masonry structures stems from the fact that the structural system is hard to be modeled by the classical Continuum Mechanics approach. The problem gets more complicated when imperfections, such as cracks are present. An example of a single multi-drum column, with fractured drums, is studied herein, using the Distinct Element Method (DEM). The purpose of the research is the investigation of the impact of the fractures to the overall stability of the structure. The 3D DEM numerical results are explained on the basis of simple 2D analytical considerations. The shear and normal crack deformation is monitored and the minimum required strength of the crack interface is quantified. An experimental program of direct shear tests is set in order to estimate the strength of the marble-cement interface. The experimental values are compared to the minimum required from the numerical analysis.",

Such functions meet the main requirements of Ball’s fundamental existence theory. We demonstrate that a formulation based on the principal invariants of the right stretch tensor, which has advanced analytical work to a considerable degree, furnishes a natural setting for this purpose. It is shown that this formulation is amenable to numerical treatment in that it does not require explicit polar decompositions or eigenanalysis. We thus adapt to a computational setting a formulation of isotropic finite elasticity theory which has been highly successful in analytical studies.",

    "abstract": "Koiter’s linear shell theory applies to isotropic elastic materials and to anisotropic materials that exhibit reflection symmetry of the elastic properties with respect to the shell mid-surface. To the extent that such shells are exceptional, classical linear shell theory is incomplete. This lacuna is addressed here through a systematic procedure, applicable equally to all kinds of material symmetry, which entails an expansion of the potential energy of the shell in powers of its thickness in a manner reminiscent of Koiter’s work. The variables are the displacement field of the shell mid-surface and certain director fields that arise in the course of the expansion procedure. The directors are constrained in accordance with necessary conditions arising in the exact three-dimensional theory, yielding the optimal expression for the potential energy among those of third order in the small thickness. For materials lacking reflection symmetry, it is found that the strain energy of the shell is sensitive to tangential gradients of strain in addition to the usual strain and bending strain of the conventional theory.",

This affords a systematic framework for the proper understanding of established models of plasticity and for their modern extensions and generalizations. Particular emphasis is placed on the differential-geometric aspects of the subject and their role in illuminating the kinematical basis of plasticity theory. Classical models, together with several alternatives of interest in contemporary research, are developed in a unified format. The book is addressed to graduate students and specialists working in the field of continuum mechanics.",

Through partitioning, simulations of complex physical systems are becoming evermore present in the scientific modeling community, making the Verification and Validation (V&V) of partitioned models to quantifying the predictive capability of their simulations increasingly important. Partitioning presents unique challenges, as well as opportunities, for the V&V community. Verification gains a new level of complexity in partitioned models, as numerical errors can easily be introduced at the coupling interface where non-matching domains and models are integrated together. For validation, partitioned analysis allows the quantification of the uncertainties and errors in constituent models through comparison against separateeffect experiments conducted in independent constituent domains. Such experimental validation is important as uncertainties and errors in the predictions of constituents can be transferred across their interfaces, either compensating for each other or accumulating during iterative coupling operations. This paper reviews published literature on methods for assessing and improving the predictive capability of strongly coupled models of physical and engineering systems with an emphasis on advancements made in the last decade.",

They produce diffusion on graphs and waves on graphs. We compute these four matrices and find accurate approximations with a variety of boundary conditions. On the whole line the matrices are Toeplitz (shift-invariant). On an interval they have a Hankel part (anti-shift-invariant). Our favorite matrix K is Toeplitz from Dirichlet conditions, but we show why Hankel also appears in the solution. Any symmetric choice of the four corner entries of K leads to Toeplitz plus Hankel in all functions f (K).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Some properties of the tensor algebra on manifolds are discussed with respect to the classical tensor algebra of continuum mechanics. Basic definitions and relations of linear maps are briefly recalled and applied to tensor spaces, where special attention is focused to the definition of dual and transposed maps. As application to nonlinear continuum mechanics, algebraic pull‐back and push‐forward maps, and Lie‐like time derivatives associated with linear maps are defined and used to build up commutative schemes for deformation measures, objective deformation rates, stresses, and frame‐invariant forms of the stress power. The transition to the classical formulation of tensor algebra by identifying vector spaces and their duals is examined. It is shown how this concept enables a straight‐forward derivation of the Doyle‐Ericksen formula and its possible variants. , In diesem Aufsatz wird eine kurze Übersicht über grundlegende Begriffe der Tensoralgebra auf Mannigfaltigkeiten und ihre Anwendung auf die nichtlineare Kontinuumsmechanik gegeben. Es werden Definitionen und Begriffe der linearen Algebra auf dualen Räumen bereitgestellt, wobei insbesondere zwischen dualer und transponierter Abbildung unterschieden wird. Diese Grundlagen werden auf die nichtlineare Kontinuumsmechanik zur Beschreibung der Kinematik der lokalen Deformationen angewandt. Es werden verallgemeinerte push‐forward/pull‐back Abbildungen sowie eine verallgemeinerte Lie‐Ableitung eingeführt und zur Darstellung objektiver Spannungs‐ und Dehnungsmaße, objektiver Dehnungsraten und zur Herleitung möglicher Varianten der Doyle‐Ericksen‐Gleichung benutzt. Der Übergang von der Tensoralgebra auf Mannigfaltigkeiten auf die Tensoralgebra auf Euklidischen Räumen wird herausgearbeitet.",

    "abstract": "A degrading, hysteretic restoring force model for structures subjected to extreme dynamic loads has been developed by Wen (1976; 1980) and Baber and Wen (1981). A need has arisen for systematically identifying the parameters of this model. A brief discussion of the model is first presented here along with an extension developed to model displacement-dependent degrading behavior of reinforced concrete structures. A method for identifying the parameters of the model, given observed structural response, is then developed. The method is based on a classic, time domain-least squares procedure where the system parameters are obtained by solving a system of simultaneous linear equations. The parameter identification method should prove useful in developing models of complex structures for nonlinear, random vibration analysis. Based on applications of the parameter identification method, using actual structural restoring force experimental results, simple rules for determining the model parameters are suggested and presented at the conclusion.",

It is hoped that these solutions will form a convenient basis for subsequent comparison and that the tedious yet inaccurate task of reconstructing data points by graphical measurement of previously reported load–de ection curves can be avoided. Moreover, the relative convergent di culty of the problems are revealed by the number of load increments and the total number of iterations required by an automatic load incrementation scheme for attaining the converged solutions under the maximum loads.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A standardized formal theory of development/evolution, characterization and design of a wide variety of computational algorithms emanating from a generalized time weighted residual philosophy for dynamic analysis is first presented with subsequent emphasis on detailed formulations of a particular class relevant to the so‐called time integration approaches which belong to a much broader classification relevant to time discretized operators. Of fundamental importance in the present exposition is the evolution of the theoretical design and the subsequent characterization encompassing a wide variety of time discretized operators, and the proposed developments are new and significantly different from the way traditional modal type and a wide variety of step‐by‐step time integration approaches with which we are mostly familiar have been developed and described in the research literature and in standard text books over the years. The theoretical ideas and basis towards the evolution of a generalized methodology and formulations emanate under the umbrella and framework and are explained via a generalized time weighted philosophy encompassing single‐field and two‐field forms of representations of the semi‐discretized dynamic equations of motion. Therein, the developments first leading to integral operators in time, and the resulting consequences then systematically leading to and explaining a wide variety of generalized time integration operators of which the family of single‐step time integration operators and various widely recognized and new algorithms are subsets, the associated multi‐step time integration operators and a class of finite element in time integration operators, and their relationships are particularly addressed. The generalized formulations not only encompass and explain a wide variety of time discretized operators and the recovery of various original methods of algorithmic development, but furthermore, naturally inherit features for providing new avenues which have not been explored an/or exploited to‐date and permit time discretized operators to be uniquely characterized by algorithmic markers. The resulting and so‐called discrete numerically assigned [DNA] markers not only serve as a prelude towards providing a standardized formal theory of development of time discretized operators and forum for selecting and identifying time discretized operators, but also permit lucid communication when referring to various time discretized operators. That which constitutes characterization of time discretized operators are the so‐called DNA algorithmic markers which essentially comprise of both (i) the weighted time fields introduced for enacting the time discretization process, and (ii) the corresponding conditions these weighted time fields impose (dictate) upon the approximations (if any) for the dependent field variables in the theoretical development of time integrators and the associated updates of the time discretized operators. Furthermore, a single analysis code which permits a variety of choices to the analyst is now feasible for performing structural dynamics computations on modern computing platforms.

    "abstract": "A critical look and review of the so-called generalized single-step time integration method by Zhang (CMAME, 418(2024), 116503) is proved and demonstrated to be not new, but identical to and within the existing GS4-II computational framework. The following are addressed: (1) Firstly, it is claimed that 16 parameters were introduced (somewhat misleading as evident in what follows) to obtain a more generalized single-step mathematical formulation. We show that 4 conditions are made redundant with minimum consistency requirements, and thus, the framework is not new and is identical to the original version of the GS4-II computational framework with 12 parameters. (2) Then, the overshooting behavior is revisited, and the analysis, missteps, and information are clarified and corrected in this paper, which is significant. (3) Next, the time shift phenomenon is also revisited to show the recovery of the order of time accuracy in the acceleration, which is misunderstood in much of the existing literature. (4) Lastly, each design in the so-called newly proposed schemes already exists and is found in the GS4-II computational framework. In particular, via GS4-II we additionally prove and demonstrate that the so-called “‘Optimal Equivalent Single-step with Single parameter (OESS)’” scheme by Zhang (CMAME, 418(2024), 116503) is nothing but identical to the existing Three-Parameters Optimal/Generalized-𝛼 method within the GS4-II framework for physically undamped problems. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to point out that also within the GS4-II framework, for physically damped problems, U0/U0∗, TPO/G-𝛼, and OESS all share the same undesired overshooting deficiency in comparison to V0/V0∗. Numerical examples validate the issues identified about the accuracy and overshooting analysis.",

    "abstract": "Tall buildings have been traditionally designed to be symmetric rectangular, triangular or circular in plan, in order to avoid excessive seismic-induced torsional vibrations due to eccentricity, especially in seismic-prone regions like Japan. However, recent tall building design has been released from the spell of compulsory symmetric shape design, and free-style design is increasing. This is mainly due to architects’ and structural designers’ challenging demands for novel and unconventional expressions. Another important aspect is that rather complicated sectional shapes are basically good with regard to aerodynamic properties for crosswind excitations, which are a key issue in tall-building wind-resistant design. A series of wind tunnel experiments have been carried out to determine aerodynamic forces and wind pressures acting on square-plan tall building models with various configurations: corner cut, setbacks, helical and so on. The results of these experiments have led to comprehensive understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics of tall buildings with various configurations.",

A successful bridge design must be natural, simple, original, and harmonious with its surroundings. Aesthetics is not an additional consideration in the design of a bridge, but is rather an integral part of bridge design. Both the structural configuration and the aesthetics of a bridge must be considered together during the conceptual design stage. To achieve such a task, the bridge design engineer must have a good understanding of structural theory and bridge aesthetics.",

    "abstract": "The pointwise equilibrating polynomial (PEP) beam-column element has been widely used in engineering applications since 1994 as it can accurately and efficiently account for second-order P-δ effect. However, the PEP element was derived from Euler–Bernoulli beam theory and therefore the transverse shear deformation cannot be considered. In this paper, the original PEP element is rederived based on Timoshenko beam theory. The shape function for lateral displacement field adopts a fifth-order polynomial and therefore the shear strain field along the element length could be theoretically assumed as a consistent, first or second-order polynomial. This paper comprehensively studies the influence of shear strain field in different forms. It is found that the new PEP element with quadric order shear strain field can provide the most accurate results for practical use. To enhance numerical efficiency, an innovative co-rotational algorithm for three-dimensional spatial frames allowing for large load step is also proposed for second-order analysis. Several examples demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed element allowing for shear deformation.",

    "abstract": "Conventional co-rotational formulations for geometrically nonlinear analysis are based on the assumption that the finite element is only subjected to nodal loads and as a result, they are not accurate for the elements under distributed member loads. The magnitude and direction of member loads are treated as constant in the global coordinate system, but they are essentially varying in the local coordinate system for the element undergoing a large rigid body rotation, leading to the change of nodal moments at element ends. Thus, there is a need to improve the co-rotational formulations to allow for the effect. This paper proposes a new consistent corotational formulation for both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko two-dimensional beam-column elements subjected to distributed member loads. It is found that the equivalent nodal moments are affected by the element geometric change and consequently contribute to a part of geometric stiffness matrix. From this study, the results of both eigenvalue buckling and second-order direct analyses will be significantly improved. Several examples are used to verify the proposed formulation with comparison of the traditional method, which demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method in buckling analysis of frame structures under distributed member loads using a single element per member.",

In particular, both nonholonomic (path-dependent) and holonomic (path-independent) formulations are developed as special instances of the well-known mathematical programming problem known as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP). The effects of combined bending and axial force are also included through a (hexagonal) piecewise linear yield locus that can accommodate either perfect plasticity or isotropic softening. Numerical examples are given to assess the ability of the nonholonomic solution scheme proposed to trace all multiple equilibrium paths, to compare the results of the nonholonomic assumption with those of its simpler approximate holonomic counterpart, and to assess the influence of combined stresses.",

    "abstract": "For a fairly general class of second order accurate algorithms, a sub-stepping procedure is described which achieves fourth order accuracy while retaining the stability, conservation properties and implementation of the underlying second order method. Two features render the proposed approach especially attractive from a computational perspective over conventional fourth order methods. First, the improved (fourth order) accuracy is attained merely by two additional residual evaluations, with no changes in the implementation of the underlying second order method. In particular, no additional storage or extra computations of high order gradients are required. Second, for Hamiltonian systems, the stability properties and possible conservation properties of the underlying second order method, such as energy, momentum and symplectic character, are preserved. The new technique is applied to a number of standard algorithms for elastodynamics, structural and rigid body dynamics. In particular, when applied to the recently proposed (second order accurate) energy-momentum method, this approach results in a fourth order accurate energy, linear and angular momentum conserving algorithm for general Hamiltonian systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a catenary cable element for the nonlinear analysis of cable structures subjected to static and dynamic loadings. The element stiffness matrix and element nodal forces, which account for self-weight and pretension effects, are derived based on exact analytical expressions of elastic catenary. Cables encountered in cable networks as well as cable-supported bridges can be modeled using the proposed element. An incremental-iterative solution based on the Newmark direct integration method and the Newton–Raphson method is adopted for solving the nonlinear equation of motion. The accuracy and reliability of the present element are verified by comparing the predictions with those generated by commercial finite element package SAP2000, and the results given by other authors using different analytical or numerical approaches.",

    "abstract": "The stress-strain relationship of Grade 275 steel reinforcing bar under cyclic (reversed) loading is examined using experimental results obtained previously from eleven test specimens to which a variety of axial loading cycles has been applied. A Ramberg-Osgood function is fitted to the experimental stress-strain curves to follow the cyclic stress-strain behaviour after the first load run in the plastic range. The empirical constants in the function are determined by regression analysis and are found to depend mainly on the plastic strain imposed in the previous loading run. The monotonic stress-strain curve for the steel, with origin of strains suitably adjusted, is assumed to be the envelope curve giving the upper limit of stress. The resulting RambergOsgood expression and envelope is found to give good agreement with the experimentally measured cyclic stress-strain curves.",

In fact, fiber reinforced concrete is now a worldwide-used material characterized by an enhanced behavior at ultimate limit states as well as at serviceability limit states, thanks to its ability in providing a better crack control.",

    "abstract": "By resorting to Automatic Differentiation (AD) users of nonlinear PDE solvers can be relieved from the extra work of linearising a nonlinear PDE system and at the same time improve on the computational efficiency. This paper describes the main AD techniques and discusses how the operator overloading approach of AD can be extended to eliminate the overhead generally incurred with operator overloading. A recent AD system FastDer++, specially designed for this purpose, is integrated into a Least Squares solver. The necessary modifications to the general FEM algorithms. Code fragments and timing results demonstrate that (1) integrating AD with nonlinear PDE solvers leads to highly flexible code with a close resemblance to the mathematical expression of the problem, (2) coding and debugging efforts are greatly reduced, and (3) the computational efficiency is improved.",

Here a fashionable woman hangs on the arm of a much older man, implying that, despite his age, he is still capable of attracting young women. The male figure is using the élégante to enhance his position, since his male peers all turn to look at the stunning individual at his side. Tissot sets up a sensationalized visual narrative capable of holding the attention of a viewer much as it would in a newspaper article, gossip column, or serialized story.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a three-dimensional geometrically nonlinear Reissner beam theory with embedded strong discontinuities for the modeling of failure in structures and discuss its finite element implementation. Existing embedded beam theories are geometrically linear or two-dimensional, motivating the need for the present work. We propose a geometrically nonlinear beam theory that accounts for cracks through displacement discontinuities in 3D. To represent the three modes of fracture inside an element, we enrich each displacement field with an incompatible mode parameter in the form of a jump, an additional degree of freedom. We then eliminate these nodeless degrees of freedom through static condensation and evaluate them within the framework of inelasticity by utilizing an operator split solution procedure. Seeing that the coupled strain-softening problem is non-convex, we present an alternating minimization (staggered) algorithm, thus retaining a positive definite stiffness matrix. Finally, the four-parameter representation by quaternions describes a three-dimensional finite rotation. We demonstrate a very satisfying and robust performance of these new finite elements in several numerical examples, including the fracture of random lattice structures with application to fibrous materials. We show that accounting for geometrical nonlinearity in the beam formulation is necessary for direct numerical simulations of fiber networks regardless of the density.",

    "abstract": "In this work a complete formulation of the vectorial parameterization of motion is presented. This is a novel concept extending the vectorial parameterization of rotation, a class in which fall many techniques developed over the years for the analysis of problems characterized by an orientation, or attitude, field. Typical applications are seen in the derivation of the governing equations for rigid bodies, beams, shells, and general flexible multibody systems, in view of the application of numerical integration procedures that preserve the nonlinear configuration manifold of these systems. The material is presented by first reviewing the vectorial parameterization of rotation, considered as a generalization of the exponential map of rotation. After this, the vectorial parameterization of motion is derived by generalizing to a 6-D space what is done in a 3-D space for pure rotation. Again, the connection and formal analogy with the exponential map of motion is stressed. We present all the formulæ needed for a straightforward implementation in a computer program.",

In this paper we propose to serve previous years’ earthquake data as a parameter and visualize relationships, if any, among various attributes of the data set. In conclusion we aim to discover regions which are most and least prone to earthquake and the probable magnitude of earthquake at various latitudes and longitudes. Studying raw data from excel sheet is old century and very hard so we have used data mining techniques such as clustering and regression to achieve the obtained results.",

The bridge has a 17-channel permanent monitoring system that has recorded several earthquakes including the 1992 Petrolia Magnitude 7.1, with a measured ground acceleration of 0.5g at the site. An ambient vibration test was performed in 1993, which showed that the dynamic properties of the bridge are very sensitive to the level of shaking, in particular at the abutments. In June 2013, another detailed ambient vibration test was performed on the bridge. Both of the tests captured several points along both edges of the bridge deck. The largest earthquake since the 1993 ambient test was the 2010 Ferndale Magnitude 6.5, with ground accelerations of 0.36g. This paper presents the results of the 2013 ambient vibration test and compares to a reanalysis of the 1993 test using the latest available tools.",

First, we compare performance of calculating gradients for the objective function. We showed that the PyADOL-C and PyCppAD tools have much better performance for big clusters than the other ones. Second, we assess precision of these two tools by calculating the difference between the obtained at the optimal configuration gradient norms. We conclude that PyCppAD has the best performance among others, while having almost the same precision as the secondbest performing tool – PyADOL-C.",

Reissner-Simo’s theory is able to model the mechanical behaviour of slender structural members involving arbitrarily large displacements and rotations. Rod centreline displacements and cross sectional rotations are used as model variables; the exact mathematical treatment of rotations is achieved by handling them as elements of the special orthogonal group. The choice of suitable parametrizations of the rotations, and the difficulties and specificities of finite element implementations of this theory are reviewed. Numerical examples using the author’s implementation are presented, and finally the potential for future applications for form finding of bending active structures is pointed out.",

    "abstract": "An e cient and accurate locking-free corotational beam ÿnite element for the analysis of large displacements and small-strain problems is developed in this paper. Three di erent ÿnite element models based on three di erent beam theories, namely, the Euler–Bernoulli, Timoshenko, and simpliÿed Reddy theories are presented. In order to develop a single corotational ÿnite element that incorporates the kinematics of all three theories, the uniÿed linear ÿnite element model of beams developed by Reddy (Comm. Numer. Meth. Eng. 1997; 13:495–510) is included in the formulation. An incremental iterative technique based on the Newton–Raphson method is employed for the solution of the non-linear equilibrium equations. Numerical examples that demonstrate the e ciency and large rotation capability of the corotational formulation are presented. The element is validated by comparisons with exact and=or approximate solutions available in the literature. Very good agreement is found in all cases. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Studies of rocking motion aim to explain the remarkable earthquake resistence of rocking structures. State-of-the-art assessment methods are mostly based on planar models, despite ongoing efforts to understand the significance of three-dimensionality. Impacts are essential components of rocking motion. We present experimental measurements of free-rocking blocks, focusing on extreme sensitivity of impacts to geometric imperfections, unpredictability, and the emergence of three-dimensional motion via spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results inspire the development of new impact models of three dimensional facet and edge impacts of polyhedral objects. Our model is a natural generalization of existing planar models based on the seminal work of George W. Housner. Model parameters are estimated empirically for rectangular blocks. Finally, new perspectives in earthquake assessment of rocking structures are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In order to use rocking as a seismic response modification strategy along both directions of seismic excitation, a three-dimensional (3D) rocking model should be developed. Since stepping or rolling rocking structural members out of their initial position is not a desirable performance, a rocking design should not involve these modes of motion. To this end, a model that takes the aforementioned constraint into account needs to be developed. This paper examines the 3D motion of a bounded rigid cylinder that is allowed to uplift and sustain rocking and wobbling (unsteady rolling) motion without sliding or rolling out of its initial position (i.e., a 3D inverted pendulum). Thus, the cylinder is constrained to zero residual displacement at the end of its 3D motion. This 3D dynamic model of the rocking rigid cylinder has two DOFs (three when damping is included), making it the simplest 3D extension of Housner’s classical two-dimensional (2D) rocking model. The development of models with and without damping is presented first. They are simple enough to perform extensive parametric analyses. Modes of motion of the cylinder are identified and presented. Then, 3D rocking and wobbling earthquake response spectra are constructed and compared with the classical 2D rocking earthquake response spectra. The 3D bounded rocking earthquake response spectra for the ground motions considered seem to have a very simple linear form. Finally, it is shown that the use of a 2D rocking model may lead to unacceptably unconservative estimates of the 3D rocking and wobbling seismic response. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the 3D response of a slab supported by wobbling columns. The columns are not allowed neither to slide nor to roll out of their initial position. An analytical model is proposed, the equations of motion are derived, and they are solved numerically. The paper concludes that the addition of the slab makes the columns more stable. In fact, the system is almost equivalent to the response of a solitary column with the same aspect ratio yet larger size. However, it is also shown that the system is less stable than its planar counterpart and that planar analysis can only qualitatively describe the behavior of 3D structures. A case study shows that the concept could be used as a seismic isolation technique for bridges. However, more research need to be performed on defining proper intensity measures for uplifting structures, as it is shown that there is large record‐to‐record variability, even when intensity measures developed for rocking structures are used.",

    "abstract": "A reinforced concrete warehouse structure was subjected to floor loads considerably greater than design-specified values when a major collapse occurred. An explosion and a major fire occurred at the same time. Investigations were undertaken to estimate floor-load capacity and other factors to establish the cause of the crash. Details of the structure’s design and construction, and of the loads imposed, are presented. Nonlinear analyses are described in which calculations were made of the floor’s theoretical load-deformation response and of its response under fire conditions. Results indicate that nonlinear effects in reinforced concrete structures, most notably membrane action, can result in floor load capacities surprisingly larger than design values.",

    "abstract": "The classic series of beam tests conducted by Bresler and Scordelis some 40 years ago to investigate the behavior of reinforced concrete in shear, is commonly regarded as a benchmark against which finite element analysis models can be calibrated. A nominally identical set of beams was recently tested at the University of Toronto. Aspects of behavior of the original and duplicate beams are compared and discussed, including load–deformation response, load capacity, and failure mode. Generally, it was found that most aspects of behavior were well replicated. Test observations reveal that the behavior of the beams is highly influenced by crushing of concrete beneath and adjacent to the loading plates. In the case of the beams containing no shear reinforcement, failure was influenced by the reinforcement anchorage plates. The disturbances around the loading plates and anchor plates introduce complex three-dimensional effects, making the modeling of these beams using two-dimensional finite element techniques difficult. However, accuracy is substantially improved if out-of-plane confinement effects are considered. In addition to some insights on the behavior of the original beams, and on factors that should be considered in their finite element modeling, the duplicate tests also provide information on postpeak behavior.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the results from a series of ambient vibration studies conducted on the Painter Street Overpass in Rio Dell, California. Painter Street is a two-span, skewed reinforced concrete bridge with two single piers near the middle and monolithic abutments, typical of bridge overpasses in California. Strong motion instruments were installed on the bridge in 1977, and since then it has recorded the motions from more than ten significant earthquakes. Because of the valuable amount of strong motion data available, the aim of the ambient vibration tests was to determine the dynamic characteristics of the bridge at low levels of vibration and to compare these with those measured during the strong motion events. In this paper, a description of the recorded strong motion events is presented first, then the ambient vibration tests are described and the results are compared with those obtained from analyses of selected strong motion records. The magnitude of the events investigated ranges from ML=4.4 to ML=6.9, which produced accelerations of up to 0.54g at the free field site, 1.3g at the abutments, and 0.86g on the deck. The results of this study indicate that the overall dynamic properties of the bridge are very sensitive to the level of ground shaking and that soil-structure interaction is very important for this type structural system. Although the superstructure exhibited a nearly elastic response, the motions at the abutments and base of piers were significantly different for each event.",

    "abstract": "This paper concerns a novel isogeometric Timoshenko beam formulation for a geometrically nonlinear analysis of spatial beams using the total Lagrangian description. Constitutive laws for hyperelastic materials, whose behavior varies with their deformations, are widely defined by using strain energy density functions that are written in terms of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor. Many finite element beam formulations for geometrically nonlinear analyses of spatial beams are developed using the Green–Lagrange strain tensor and its energy conjugate, the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor. Unfortunately, there virtually exist no isogeometric Timoshenko beam formulations for this type of analysis that are derived by using this energy conjugate pair. To allow the possibility of considering hyperelastic materials, the present isogeometric beam formulation is developed in the total Lagrangian description using the Green–Lagrange strain tensor and the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor. The proposed formulation is capable of simulating beam structures that are subjected to large displacements and rotations, without any restriction in magnitude. Three-dimensional beam configurations are reduced into one-dimensional structures using the beam axis and director vectors of the cross sections. The cross-sectional rotation along the beam axis is represented by an orthogonal tensor, which is parameterized by a vector-like parameter. Updating the cross-sectional rotations is performed purely by natural exponentiation and superposition of relevant rotational quantities. To show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed beam formulation, some benchmark and well-established numerical examples with various types of beam, i.e., straight, curved, pre-twisted beams, are analyzed. The obtained results are compared with those results in the literature, obtained from both analytical and numerical methods.",

    "abstract": "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have found widespread use in many fields of study to estimate the average properties of complex systems, and for posterior inference in a Bayesian framework. Existing theory and experiments prove convergence of well constructed MCMC schemes to the appropriate limiting distribution under a variety of different conditions. In practice, however this convergence is often observed to be disturbingly slow. This is frequently caused by an inappropriate selection of the proposal distribution used to generate trial moves in the Markov Chain. Here we show that significant improvements to the efficiency of MCMC simulation can be made by using a self-adaptive Differential Evolution learning strategy within a population-based evolutionary framework. This scheme, entitled DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis or DREAM, runs multiple different chains simultaneously for global exploration, and automatically tunes the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution in randomized subspaces during the search. Ergodicity of the algorithm is proved, and various examples involving nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and multimodality show that DREAM is generally superior to other adaptive MCMC sampling approaches. The DREAM scheme significantly enhances the applicability of MCMC simulation to complex, multi-modal search problems.",

    "abstract": "A new simplified contact model aimed at capturing the load transfer and recovery length in parallel steel wires, commonly used in main cables of suspension bridges, is presented. The approach is based on placing elastic–perfectly plastic spring elements at the contact region between the objects. These springs have varying stiffness (Model I) or yielding (Model II) depending on their proximity to the clamping loads. Their stiffness or yielding is highest when they are closer to this force, and it decays when they are farther away from the clamp. This decayed behavior is assigned according to Boussinesq’s well-known solution to a point load (applied on a half space). Both models converge quickly compared with a full contact model and recover Coulomb friction law on a two-dimensional (2D) benchmark problem. Moreover, when the same properties are chosen for all springs (disregarding Boussinesq solutions), the models reduce to the classical shear-lag model, which for high clamping (point) loads gives inaccurate results. The spring models are validated experimentally on a seven-wire tightened strand. In this case study, the outer wires are axially pulled, whereas the middle wire, slightly shorter than the outer wires, experiences no direct applied axial load. However, because the strand is radially fastened at several locations, the axial load is transferred to the inner wire by an interfriction mechanism between the wires. The strains at the center points of the outer and inner wires are measured via neutron diffraction for different clamping loads, showing that the inner wire is capable of recovering most of the load.

What can BRAILS do BRAILS helps users create regional-scale database of building inventory, where buildings properties are extracted from satellite or street view images using deep learning. Why it’s important BIM, as an efficient way for describing buildings, gives architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) professionals the insight and tools to more efficiently plan, design, construct, and manage buildings and infrastructure. Natural disasters cause losses to human society by damaging or destroying buildings, which consequently endangers lives and goods. Buildings are the major components of a human built environment, hence are of the major considerations in planning for, responding to and recovering from disasters. BIM contains information showing building geometry, components, material, usage, etc, which makes it an ideal source for generation and running of simulations of building behavior under both normal and emergency scenarios. For example, based on BIM, structure engineers can create numerical models for dynamic simulations of seismic loading conditions.",

    "abstract": "The intensity of many natural hazards, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, etc., are increasing as a consequence of climate change. This increase in intensity coupled with the increase in population density, particularly along the coasts, is only magnifying the impact of such events. In order to quantify and mitigate the risk due to the hazards and to prepare for the potential impacts in a region, it is necessary to collect the information of existing buildings that are pertinent to natural hazard analysis and risk management. Gathering the building information in a region- or city-scale is a laborious and expensive undertaking. This paper presents a framework for regional scale building information generation/gathering to support regional hazard analysis. In this framework, different types of data are acquired from multiple sources (satellite and street view images, property tax assessment data, etc.) and are fused to semantically profile each building in a city. Specifically, deep learning technique is employed to extract building information from street or satellite images. A novel data mining tool is developed to overcome the data scarcity issue, quantify the uncertainty and enrich the data repository. With this framework, building inventories of cities are created to provide the data needed for disaster and risk management planning and simulations.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive review on modal parameter-based damage identification methods for beam- or plate-type structures is presented, and the damage identification algorithms in terms of signal processing are particularly emphasized. Based on the vibration features, the damage identification methods are classified into four major categories: natural frequency-based methods, mode shape-based methods, curvature mode shape-based methods, and methods using both mode shapes and frequencies, and their merits and drawbacks are discussed. It is observed that most mode shape-based and curvature mode shape-based methods only focus on damage localization. In order to precisely locate the damage, the mode shape-based methods have to rely on optimization algorithms or signal processing techniques; while the curvature mode shape-based methods are in general a very effective type of damage localization algorithms. As an implementation, a comparative study of five extensively-used damage detection algorithms for beam-type structures is conducted to evaluate and demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the signal processing algorithms. This brief review aims to help the readers in identifying starting points for research in vibration-based damage identification and structural health monitoring and guides researchers and practitioners in better implementing available damage identification algorithms and signal processing methods for beam- or plate-type structures.",

The technique permits computation of numerical values of derivatives without developing analytical expressions for the derivatives. The key to the method is the decomposition of the given function, by introduction of intermediate variables, into a series of elementary functional steps. A library of elementary function subroutines is provided for the automatic evaluation and differentiation of these new variables. The final step in this process produces the desired function’s derivative. The main feature of this approach is its simplicity. It can be used as a quick-reaction tool where the derivation of analytical derivatives is laborious and also as a debugging tool for programs which contain derivatives.",

Resultsof this application show that (1) linear models provide an excellent fit to the measured motions of the bridge, despite the fact that it was subjected to very strongshaking; (2) the transverse response of the structure is controlled by its abutment motions, with no significant dynamic amplificationin the deck; and (3) the vertical responseof the bridge deck at the midlengthof its spans is dominated by a single vertical translational mode whereas, above the central pier, the deck’s vertical response is most affected by the vertical motions of the pier base and by torsion of the deck. Also, systematic estimates of modal damping ratios and qualitative assessments of states of stress developed in the bridge during the earthquake are provided.",

    "abstract": "Standard provisions for wind loads on buildings have traditionally been based on summary tables and/or plots suitable for slide-rule calculations. The accuracy in the definition of wind loads inherent in such tables and plots is far lower than that inherent in current methods for stress computation. Advances in computational power now make it possible to reduce this discrepancy and achieve structural designs for wind that are significantly safer and more economical than current designs. This is true both for routine, low-rise structures and for flexible structures experiencing significant dynamic effects. In this paper, we present the concept of database-assisted design (DAD) along with a discussion of the application software Wind Load Design Environment, a user-friendly tool for designers and code writers that employs the DAD approach. The DAD approach entails the use of large databases of aerodynamic pressures, the optional use of databases of directional extreme wind speeds, and the use of structural information needed for the description of linear or nonlinear structural behavior. We present progress achieved to date, describe current efforts and future needs, and discuss the implications of DAD for reliability-based design and performance-based standards development.",

Locking is confirmed by the observed seismic deformationsof the structure in the fundamental mode. Fundamental vertical frequencies of the individual spans, predicted by the finite element model, are in very good agreement with ambient vibration test data.",

The model permits an evaluation of six equivalent discrete spring stiffnesses for three translational and three rotational degrees-of-freedom of the abutment and includes effects of the abutment walls, pile foundations and soil. These springs can be incorporated as boundary elements in a more detailed finite element analysis of the dynamic response of the bridge superstructure. A parametric study examines a range of abutment stiffnesses for 2, 4 and 6 lane highway bridges. Application of the model to a single span bridge indicates the importance of including abutment stiffness in the determination of bridge frequencies and mode shapes in the transverse and vertical directions.",

    "abstract": "Strong-motion earthquake data obtained on the Meloland Road Overpass during the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake are used to examine the suitability of simple models for representing the transverse and vertical stiffnesses of the abutment-embankment systems on highway bridges. Information on the seismic responses of both the abutment-embankment systems and the bridge superstructure is obtained by applying techniques of system identification to the strong-motion records. Analytic models, as developed in a companion paper, that account for the transverse and vertical stiffness characteristics of the bridge abutment systems are used to calculate equivalent abutment stiffnesses for incorporation into finite element models of the Meloland bridge. Predicted earthquake responses of these models are compared to the measured seismic responses and to optimal modal parameters obtained from the system identifications. Results of the various analyses show that the simplified models work quite well in simulating the stiffnesses of the abutments and are able to predict with good accuracy the frequencies and mode shapes of the first symmetric transverse and first symmetric vertical modes of the bridge. These two modes are the major contributors to the seismic response of this bridge. Use of the abutment stiffness models also provides insight into the damping ratios that have been observed for the bridge response.",

In the first part of the model, an expression is developed for identification of the fundamental transverse frequency of the earth embankment. In the second part, two simple equivalent springs are used to represent the transverse and vertical stiffness of a monolithic abutment system. The springs are based on linear elastic planestrain analysis of a typical trapezoidal-shaped embankment cross section. The spring stiffnesses are related to the cross-sectional dimensions and the soil properties of the earth embankment, which supports the bridge abutments. These stiffnesses can be incorporated into a detailed dynamic model of the superstructure as the equivalent stiffnesses of the bridge abutments. The frequency and the translational stiffnesses predicted by the model are in good agreement with results from a more complicated analytic theory and from finite element analysis of the abutment soil system. A companion paper illustrates an application of the model and provides comparisons to recorded earthquake responses.",

Recent research has indicated that a simple numerical correction can be applied to the shape functions in order that the constant-strain patch test is passed. In this paper a new method of stress recovery is presented in which incompatible modes are introduced. A least-square approximation is used to calculate element stresses which are in microscopic equilibrium and tend to be in global equilibrium with the applied nodal loads on the finite element assemblage. Also, a consistent and robust method for the evaluation of thermal stresses is presented. The numerical methods presented are general and can be applied to all displacement-based finite elements. The basic formulation and examples which are presented in this paper are in three-dimensional elasticity using the eight-node isoparametric elements. Accuracy of the element is illustrated and it is demonstrated that both displacements and stresses are alsmost identical to those produced by Pian’s hybrid stress elements.",

The second part of the paper is to present a few recently developed numerical algorithms for dynamic analysis that are required in the design of wind, wave and earthquake resistant structures. These algorithms have been incorporated into the SAP 2000 programs (developed by Computers and Structures, Inc. in Berkeley) and have been used in the analysis of hundreds of large structural systems. This most recent research and development work was conducted since the author’s retirement in1991 from teaching at the University.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a five-step algorithm to determine the reasonable state of suspension bridges with spatial cables without theoretical derivation or original programming. The algorithm is extended from the common FEM analysis method with additional algebraic operation and flow control. The five-step algorithm is an efficient and convenient method for the general bridge designers in normal engineering practice and can be summarized as follows. In the first four steps, a main cable–only model is used considering the couple of the spatial main cable and inclined hangers. First, a set of ideal vertical components of the hanger forces is obtained by the rigid-supported continuous beam method. Second, the shape of the main cable in the midspan is calculated iteratively based on the designated sag. Third, the reasonable state of the main cable in the side span is determined by the force equilibrium of the IP point. Fourth, the anchor span is solved by the equilibrium of the splay saddle. Finally, a full-bridge model is activated and specially handled to complete the analysis. Next, a 1,588-m midspan suspension bridge with spatial cables is introduced as a case study. Several details and strategies are also presented. It is proved that the algorithm can avoid the theoretical derivation and simplify the programming on the premise of the necessary numerical precision.

    "abstract": "This study aims to realistically simulate the seismic responses of typical highway bridges in California with considerations of soil–structure interaction effects. The p-y modeling approaches are developed and validated for embankments and pile foundations of bridges. The p-y approach models the lateral and vertical foundation flexibility with distributed p-y springs and associated t-z and q-z springs. Building upon the existing p-y models for pile foundations, the study develops the nonlinear p-y springs for embankments based on nonlinear 2D and 3D continuum finite element analysis under passive loading condition along both longitudinal and transverse directions. Closed-form expressions are developed for two key parameters, the ultimate resistant force pult and the displacement y50, where 0.5pult is reached, of embankment p-y models as functions of abutment geometry (wall width and height, embankment fill height, etc.) and soil material properties (wall-soil friction angle, soil friction angle, and cohesion). In order to account for the kinematic and site responses, depthvarying ground motions are derived and applied at the free-end of p-y springs, which reflects the amplified embankment crest motion. The modeling approach is applied to simulate the seismic responses of the Painter Street Bridge and validated through comparisons with the recorded responses during the 1992 Petrolia earthquake. It is demonstrated that the flexibility and motion amplification at end abutments are the most crucial modeling aspects. The developed p-y models and the modeling approach can effectively predict the seismic responses of highway bridges. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for analyzing the geometrically non-linear behavior of elastic planar frames based on continuum mechanics principles. With the inclusion of non-linear stiffness matrices, the effects of bowing and rotation are taken into account in the calculation of element forces. Such non-linear stiffness matrices have also enabled the element, which in general is acted upon by a set of self-equilibrating nodal forces, to pass the rigid body test in the non-linear sense. In an incremental-iterative non-linear analysis, distinction must be made between the ’predictor’ and ’corrector’ phase. The former deals with the solution of structural displacements from the structure equations, while the latter is concerned with the calculation of element forces from element displacements. It is the latter that governs the accuracy of an incremental-iterative non-linear analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate that equations of higher-order accuracy should be used in the corrector phase to avoid possible errors.",

Theoretical formulations are derived from the second law of thermodynamics, in conjunction with a few plausible assumptions on energy transformation and dissipation. The role of plastic free energy is emphasized by a conceptual experiment showing its physical nature. Theoretical formulation is adapted in order to be applied in elastic–plastic finite element method (FEM) simulations. Developed methodology is verified through comparison of input work, stored energy, and energy dissipation of the system. Separation of plastic work into plastic free energy and energy dissipation removes a common mistake, made in a number of publications, where energy dissipation can attain negative values (energy production) which is impossible.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical and computational aspects of rotation vector and its complement parameterization are examined in detail in this paper. The mutual relationships between the variations of rotation vector and its complement and the spin variable are presented. It shows that the switch of rotation parameter between rotation vector and its complement preserves not only the strains but also the angular velocity and acceleration, and the force vectors and tangent matrices of an element. Two singularity-free corotational shell element formulations are presented. The first formulation is a non-consistent one, in which a simple way only using rotation vector is proposed to modify the exact rotation update approach via the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula, while the second formulation is a consistent one. The novelty is that, following the presented method, the existing singular spatial beam and shell element formulations based on rotation vector parameterization could be modified to be the singularity-free ones with only a few changes. Finally, three numerical examples involving large rotations are analyzed to demonstrate the capability of the presented formulations.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to extend the Green–Naghdi–Rivlin balance of energy method to continua with microstructure. The key idea is to replace the group of Galilean transformations with the group of diffeomorphisms of the ambient space. A key advantage is that one obtains in a natural way all the needed balance laws on both the macro and micro levels along with two Doyle–Erickson formulas. We model a structured continuum as a triplet of Riemannian manifolds: a material manifold, the ambient space manifold of material particles and a director field manifold. The Green–Naghdi–Rivlin theorem and its extensions for structured continua are critically reviewed. We show that when the ambient space is Euclidean and when the microstructure manifold is the tangent space of the ambient space manifold, postulating a single balance of energy law and its invariance under time-dependent isometries of the ambient space, one obtains conservation of mass, balances of linear and angular momenta but not a separate balance of linear momentum. We develop a covariant elasticity theory for structured continua by postulating that energy balance is invariant under time-dependent spatial diffeomorphisms of the ambient space, which in this case is the product of two Riemannian manifolds. We then introduce two types of constrained continua in which microstructure manifold is linked to the reference and ambient space manifolds. In the case when at every material point, the microstructure manifold is the tangent space of the ambient space manifold at the image of the material point, we show that the assumption of covariance leads to balances of linear and angular momenta with contributions from both forces and micro-forces along with two Doyle–Ericksen formulas. We show that generalized covariance leads to two balances of linear momentum and a single coupled balance of angular momentum. Using this theory, we covariantly obtain the balance laws for two specific examples, namely elastic solids with distributed voids and mixtures. Finally, the Lagrangian field theory of structured elasticity is revisited and a connection is made between covariance and Noether’s theorem.",

The present formulation, based on the Timoshenko beam hypothesis, is capable of effectively solving geometrically nonlinear problems such as large deformation, postbuckling, lateral buckling, and snap-through problems. The kinematics have been constructed with the concept of co-rotational formulation adopted in the finite element method (FEM). A meshfree method based on the differential reproducing kernel (DRK) approximation collocation method, combined with the Newton–Raphson method, is employed to solve the strong forms of the geometrically nonlinear problems. The DRK method takes full advantage of the meshfree method. Moreover, only a scattered set of nodal points is necessary for the discretization. No elements or mesh connectivity data are required. Therefore, DRK will be able to completely circumvent the problems of mesh dependence and mesh distortion. The effectiveness of this study and its performance are shown through several numerical applications.",

The theories used here are the Timoshenko beam theory of finite displacements with finite strains and that with small strains. Elliptic integral solutions are further transformed to normal forms to obtain accurate solutions. As a result, both of the closed-form solutions are expressed in normal forms from the first to the third kind of elliptic integrals. With these solutions, two kinds of structures are analyzed to examine the effect of shear deformations along with the accuracy of the approximate theory of finite displacements with small strains.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and accurate identification of potential structural deficiencies is a crucial task in evaluating seismic vulnerability of large building inventories in a region. In the case of multi-story structures, abrupt vertical variations of story stiffness are known to significantly increase the likelihood of collapse during moderate or severe earthquakes. Identifying and retrofitting buildings with such irregularities—generally termed as soft-story buildings—is, therefore, vital in earthquake preparedness and loss mitigation efforts. Soft-story building identification through conventional means is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this study, an automated procedure was devised based on deep learning techniques for identifying soft-story buildings from street-view images at a regional scale. A database containing a large number of building images and a semi-automated image labeling approach that effectively annotates new database entries was developed for developing the deep learning model. Extensive computational experiments were carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed procedure, and to gain insights into automated soft-story building identification.",

    "abstract": "Structures under dynamic loading usually exhibit nonlinear hysteretic behavior, especially under strong earthquake excitation. The exact nature of this behavior may vary greatly from structure to structure. Therefore, a lot of onedimensional hysteretic models have been developed, including the smooth-varying and piecewise-linear (PWL) varieties. In this paper, we present a synthesis and extension of the myriad hysteretic structural models into a general nonlinear hysteretic model, which is mathematically tractable and covers smooth-varying hysteretic models and various PWL hysteretic models. Because the formulation developed to describe the equation of motion is a nonlinear state equation, we can find the dynamic response explicitly, based on the explicit-integration approach, and dependably in both deterministic and stochastic ways. Based on the formulation, we also demonstrate the similarity of the responses of the PWL and smoothvarying hysteretic models. Finally, we add some comments on the extension of stochastic equivalent linearization techniques by smoothing the PWL hysteric models.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing that soil-structure interaction affects appreciably the earthquake response of highway overcrossings, this paper compares approximate analytical solutions and finite element results to conclude on a simple procedure that allows for the estimation of the kinematic response functions and dynamic stiffnesses of approach embankments. It is shown that the shear-wedge model yields realistic estimates for the amplification functions of typical embankments and reveals the appropriate levels of dynamic strains which are subsequently used to estimate the stiffness and damping coefficients of embankments. The shear-wedge model is extended to a twodimensional model in order to calculate the transverse static stiffness of an approach embankment loaded at one end. The formulation leads to a sound closed-form expression for the critical length, Lc , that is the ratio of the transverse static stiffness of an approach embankment and the transverse static stiffness of a unit-width wedge. It is shown through two case studies that the transverse dynamic stiffness (“spring” and “dashpot”) of the approach embankment can be estimated with confidence by multiplying the dynamic stiffness of the unit-width wedge with the critical length, Lc . The paper concludes that the values obtained for the transverse kinematic response function and dynamic stiffness can also be used with confidence to represent the longitudinal kinematic response function and dynamic stiffness respectively.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic procedure for the seismic response analysis of highway overcrossings. The study employs an elementary stick model and a more sophisticated ÿnite element formulation to compute response quantities. All dynamic sti nesses of approach embankments and pile groups are approximated with frequency-independent springs and dashpots that have been established elsewhere. A real eigenvalue analysis conÿrms the one-to-one correspondence between modal characteristics obtained with the three-dimensional ÿnite element solutions and the result of the simpler stick-model idealization. A complex eigenvalue analysis yields modal damping values in the ÿrst six modes of interest and shows that modal damping ratios assume values much higher than those used by Caltrans. The validity of the proposed method is examined by comparing the computed time response quantities with records from the Meloland Road and Painter Street overcrossings located in southern and northern California, respectively. The proposed procedure allows for inexpensive parametric analysis that examines the importance of considering soil–structure interaction at the end abutments and centre bent. Results and recommendations presented by past investigations are revisited and integrated in comprehensive tables that improve our understanding of the dynamic characteristics and behaviour of freeway overcrossings. The study concludes with a step-by-step methodology that allows for a simple, yet dependable dynamic analysis of freeway overcrossings, that involves a stick model and frequency-independent springs and dashpots.

In this paper, a comprehensive solution based on the elliptic integrals is proposed for solving large deflection problems. By explicitly incorporating the number of inflection points and the sign of the end-moment load in the derivation, the comprehensive solution is capable of solving large deflections of thin beams with multiple inflection points and subject to any kinds of load cases. The comprehensive solution also extends the elliptic integral solutions to be suitable for any beam end angle. Deflected configurations of complex modes solved by the comprehensive solution are presented and discussed. The use of the comprehensive solution in analyzing compliant mechanisms is also demonstrated by examples.",

    "abstract": "Beam-column joints are regions of high inelastic stress concentration in reinforced concrete (RC) frames. Evidence of the vulnerability of the joints to damage during earthquakes is witnessed in panel zone failures. Corrosion of reinforcement will cause the deterioration of joint behavior under seismic actions, especially for structures in coastal areas. In the study described in this paper, the performance of corroded RC interior as well as exterior beam-column joints subjected to simulated seismic loads were investigated by employing a twodimensional (2D) nonlinear finite-element (FE) OpenSees model of deterioration of materials as well as the bond-slip effects in joints. The accuracy of the model was verified and calibrated by comparing the FE analysis results against experimental results from the literature. After that, a parametric study was performed to investigate the impacts of some key parameters on the shear strength of corroded joints. A total of 360 specimens were simulated based on the FE model. Finally, these important parameters were integrated into two fitting equations to predict the shear strength of corroded interior and exterior beam-column joints.

A key feature of OpenSees is the ability to integrate existing libraries and new components into the framework without the need to change the existing code. The non-linear beam-column element theory in OpenSees is based on the assumption that torsion is uniform through the length of the member and non-uniform warping torsion is excluded. In this report, a corotational mapping for three-dimensional analyses of doubly symmetric beam-column elements with warping effects is incorporated into OpenSees. Both a local linear strain assumption and a second order approximation of the Green-Lagrange strains are considered in the formulations of the beam elements at local level.

    "abstract": "This article is concerned with finite element implementations of the threedimensional geometrically exact rod. The special attention is paid to identifying the condition that ensures the frame invariance of the resulting discrete approximations. From the perspective of symmetry, this requirement is equivalent to the commutativity of the employed interpolation operator I with the action of the special Euclidean group SE(3), or I is SE(3)-equivariant. This geometric criterion helps to clarify several subtle issues about the interpolation of finite rotation. It leads us to reexamine the finite element formulation first proposed by Simo in his work on energy-momentum conserving algorithms. That formulation is often mistakenly regarded as non-objective. However, we show that the obtained approximation is invariant under the superposed rigid body motions, and as a corollary, the objectivity of the continuum model is preserved. The key of this proof comes from the observation that since the numerical quadrature is used to compute the integrals, by storing the rotation field and its derivative at the Gauss points, the equivariant conditions can be relaxed only at these points. Several numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the performance of this algorithm.",

The seismic performance of the structural elements such as column will be overestimated if the inelastic buckling is not incorporated in the material model. The Monti-Nuti Model could consider the buckling effect properly. The critical slenderness and anisotropy were discussed which has an important effect on the seismic behaviors of the reinforcement. Then this paper proposed a modified Monti-Nuti Model for different types of reinforcing bars, such as carbon steel reinforcement and stainless steel reinforcement including inelastic buckling.

    "abstract": "As a passive energy dissipation device, the fluid viscous damper (FVD) is effective for mitigating wind or seismic load-induced vibrations. In this paper, the effects of FVDs for a cable-stayed bridge under randomly generated earthquake excitation are investigated. The FVD is modeled as a simplified Maxwell model, which consists of a linear spring in series with a nonlinear dashpot. The pile is modeled as a beam on the nonlinear Winkler foundation, and the soil–pile interactions are simulated by using continuously distributed hysteretic springs and viscous dashpots placed in parallel. Three random ground motions are generated from the earthquake risk assessment based on the seismotectonics and seismicity analysis of the bridge location. The seismic response of the cable-stayed bridge with FVD considering soil–structure interactions (SSIs) is obtained by solving the equations of motion in the time domain using a direct integration method. Parametric studies are conducted for the two key parameters in the simplified Maxwell model, namely, the damping coefficient C and the damping exponent α. The results indicate that the FVD is very efficient in reducing the displacement response of the cable-stayed bridge and the bending moment of the tower while simultaneously limiting the shear force in the tower. Compared with the linear FVD, the nonlinear FVD has a better performance in reducing the seismic response of the cable-stayed bridge. The maximum displacement response of the deck and the tower, when implementing the nonlinear FVD, could be reduced up to 79 and 77%, respectively, whereas the maximum reduction of the corresponding displacement response with the linear FVD drops to 51 and 50%, respectively. The reduction of the bending moment of the tower using nonlinear FVD could be up to 56%, whereas the maximum reduction of the corresponding response using linear FVD is 40%. After the parametric study, an optimal design of the FVD is chosen and implemented in the final bridge design. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000262. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

The framework allows users to perform finite element analysis with a scripting language and for developers to create both serial and parallel finite element computer applications as interpreters. For the last 15 years, Tcl has been the primary scripting language to which the model building and analysis modules of OpenSees are linked. To provide users with different scripting language options, particularly Python, the OpenSees interpreter interface was refactored to provide multi-interpreter capabilities. This refactoring, resulting in the creation of OpenSeesPy as a Python module, is accomplished through an abstract interface for interpreter calls with concrete implementations for different scripting languages. Through this approach, users are able to develop applications that utilize the unique features of several scripting languages while taking advantage of advanced finite element analysis models and algorithms.",

This derivation is much simpler than that involved originally in the Newmark presentation, and indicates a very wide range of possibilities of approximation. The application of the process to four point (cubic) algorithms leads to another family of formulas of which the Houbolt algorithm is a particular case.",

    "abstract": "Frame finite-element models permit obtaining, at moderate computational cost, significant information on the dynamic response behavior of steel–concrete composite ͑SCC͒ frame structures. As an extension of conventional monolithic beam models, composite beams with deformable shear connection were specifically introduced and adopted for the analysis of SCC beams, in which the flexible shear connection allows development of partial composite action influencing structural deformation and distribution of stresses. The use of beams with deformable shear connection in the analysis of frame structures raises very specific modeling issues, such as the characterization of the cyclic behavior of the deformable shear connection and the assembly of composite beam elements with conventional beam–column elements. In addition, the effects on the dynamic response of SCC frame structures of various factors, such as the shear connection boundary conditions and the mass distribution between the two components of the composite beam, are still not clear and deserve more investigation. The object of this paper is to provide deeper insight into the natural vibration properties and nonlinear seismic response behavior of SCC frame structures and how they are influenced by various modeling assumptions. For this purpose, a materially nonlinear-only finite-element formulation is used for static and dynamic response analyses of steel–concrete frame structures using composite beam elements with deformable shear connection. Realistic uniaxial cyclic constitutive laws are adopted for the steel and concrete materials of the beams and columns and for the shear connection. The resulting finite-element model for a benchmark problem is validated using experimental test results from the literature for quasi-static cyclic tests. The paper then focuses on the numerical simulation, based on various modeling assumptions, of the eigenproperties and seismic response of a realistic two-dimensional five-story two-bay moment resisting frame made of steel columns and SCC beams and designed according to the Eurocode. It is found that the inclusion of the deformability of the shear connection in the finite-element model has a significant effect on the global dynamic response of SCC frame structures. In modeling this type of structures by using frame elements with deformable shear connection, a proper representation of the shear connection boundary conditions for all composite beams is crucial for accurate response simulation.",

    "abstract": "The majority of continuous girder bridges in regions of moderate seismicity were designed before the introduction of modern seismic codes that prescribe seismic design verification for such structures. The objective of this study is to investigate the seismic performance of typical Hungarian continuous girder bridges through a parametric study. A design space is described by a set of eight parameters. More than 10,000 bridge archetypes are designed without any seismic verification to mimic the design of conventional bridges. The seismic performance of each archetype is then evaluated with modal response spectrum analysis of a detailed finite-element model. The results highlight the vulnerability of piers and bearings and imply that the superstructures are not expected to fail under moderate ground motion intensities. Long bridges with short piers and large spans show the worst performance, especially if the number of fixed bearings in the longitudinal direction is small. This indicates the large influence of the longitudinal ground motion component on the overall response. Based on the fair performance of the investigated structures, detailed inspection and strengthening of similar bridges in moderately seismic areas is recommended.

    "abstract": "This research is part of a larger effort to better understand and quantify the epistemic model uncertainty in dynamic response-history simulations. This paper focuses on how calibration methods influence model uncertainty. Structural models in earthquake engineering are typically built up from independently calibrated component models. During component calibration, engineers often use experimental component response under quasi-static loading to find parameters that minimize the error in structural response under dynamic loading. Since the calibration and the simulation environments are different, if a calibration method wants to provide optimal parameters for simulation, it has to focus on features of the component response that are important from the perspective of global structural behavior. Relevance describes how efficiently a calibration method can focus on such important features. A framework of virtual experiments and a methodology is proposed to evaluate the influence of calibration relevance on model error in simulations. The evaluation is demonstrated through a case study with Buckling Restrained Braced Frames. Two calibration methods are compared in the case study. The first, highly relevant calibration method is based on stiffness and hardening characteristics of braces; the second, less relevant calibration method is based on the axial force response of braces. The highly relevant calibration method consistently identified the preferable parameter sets. In contrast, the less relevant calibration method showed poor to mediocre performance. The framework and methodology presented here are not limited to BRBF. They have the potential to facilitate and systematize the improvement of component-model calibration methods for any structural system.",

    "abstract": "A model of 3D rigid body with a rectangular base, able to rock around a side or a vertex of the base is developed. Eccentricity of the center of mass with respect to the geometrical center of the body is also considered. The equations of motion are obtained through the general balance principle. A one-sine pulse base excitation is applied to the body in different directions. The analyses are conducted with the aim to highlight the role of the period, the amplitude and the direction of the external excitation. In significant ranges of the previous parameters, the results obtained with a bi-dimensional model, that does not consider the 3D rocking motions on a vertex of the base, are not in favor of safety. It is found, in fact, that in several conditions the overturning of the 3D block takes place for amplitudes of excitation smaller than those able to overturn the 3D block.",

From the generalized virtual work principle, where the unity constraint of the rotational quaternion is properly considered and the consistent energy complements of the rotational quaternions are employed, we derive the weak kinematic equations in the quaternion-based description. These equations are then employed in the extended virtual work principle to obtain the consistent governing equations of the three-dimensional beam in terms of the quaternion algebra. The quaternion moment equilibrium equation is analyzed, discussed, and interpreted. In numerical implementation, the standard Galerkin discretization is used to obtain the quaternion-based finite-element formulation. Various examples prove the suitability of the formulation.",

As a starting point we will describe the special structure of finite element codes and the implications that this code design carries for an efficient calculation of the Jacobian matrix. We will also propose a first approach towards improving the efficiency of such a method.
