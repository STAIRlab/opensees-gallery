Torsional buckling under axial force is a constitutive phenomenon in the context of intrinsic frame theories.
The critical buckling load for the torsional buckling of column subjected to axial compression is given by $[15,16]$ :

$$
N_x=\left(G J+\pi^2 E I_w / L^2\right) / r_2^2
$$

where $r_2^2=\left(I_y+I_z\right) / A+y_0^2+z_0^2$. Using the properties from Table 1 , the elastic torsional buckling
