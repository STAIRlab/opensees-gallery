This example is an extension of the <a
href="Pushover_Analysis_of_2-Story_Moment_Frame"
title="wikilink">Pushover Analysis of 2-Story Moment Frame</a> and <a
href="Dynamic_Analysis_of_2-Story_Moment_Frame" title="wikilink">
Dynamic Analysis of 2-Story Moment Frame</a> examples which illustrates
the explicit modeling of shear distortions in panel zones and uses
reduced beam sections (RBS) which are offset from the panel zones. Both
pushover and dynamic analyses are performed in this example. The
structure is the same 2-story, 1-bay steel moment resisting frame used
in the other examples where the nonlinear behavior is represented using
the concentrated plasticity concept with rotational springs. The
rotational behavior of the plastic regions follows a bilinear hysteretic
response based on the Modified Ibarra Krawinkler Deterioration Model
(Ibarra et al. 2005, Lignos and Krawinkler 2009, 2010). For this
example, all modes of cyclic deterioration are neglected. A leaning
column carrying gravity loads is linked to the frame to simulate \(P-\Delta\)
effects.

<p>The 2-story, 1-bay steel moment resisting frame is modeled with <a
href="elastic_Beam_Column_Element" title="wikilink">elastic beam-column
elements</a> connected by <a href="zeroLength_Element"
title="wikilink">zeroLength elements</a> which serve as rotational
springs to represent the structure’s nonlinear behavior. The springs
follow a <a href="Bilin_Material" title="wikilink">bilinear</a>
hysteretic response based on the Modified Ibarra Krawinkler
Deterioration Model. The panel zones are explicitly modeled with eight
<a href="elastic_Beam_Column_Element" title="wikilink">elastic
beam-column elements</a> and one <a href="zeroLength_Element"
title="wikilink">zeroLength element</a> which serves as rotational

column with gravity loads is linked to the frame by <a
href="Truss_Element" title="wikilink">truss elements</a> to simulate

Figure 1.</p>
<p>A detailed description of this model is provided in <a
href="Pushover_Analysis_of_2-Story_Moment_Frame"
title="wikilink">Pushover Analysis of 2-Story Moment Frame</a>. This
section merely highlights the important differences in this model,
namely the inclusion of panel zones and reduced beam sections (RBS)
which are offset from the panel zones.</p>
<p>The units of the model are kips, inches, and seconds.</p>

<h3 id="panel_zones">Panel Zones</h3>
<p>The panel zone is the joint region where beams and columns intersect.
In this model it consists of the rectangular area of the column web that
lies between the flanges of the connecting beam(s). The panel zone
deforms primarily in shear due to the opposing moments in the beams and
columns. To capture these deformations, the panel zone is explicitly
modeled using the approach of Gupta and Krawinkler (1999) as a rectangle
composed of eight very stiff <a href="elastic_Beam_Column_Element"
title="wikilink">elastic beam-column elements</a> with one <a
href="zeroLength_Element" title="wikilink">zeroLength element</a> which
serves as rotational spring to represent shear distortions in the panel
zone (see Figure 2). At the three corners of the panel zone without a
spring, the elements are joined by a simple pin connection which is
achieved by using the <a href="EqualDOF_command"
title="wikilink">equalDOF</a> command to constrain both translational
degrees of freedom. The eight <a href="elastic_Beam_Column_Element"
title="wikilink">elastic beam-column elements</a> each have an area of
1,000.0 in<sup>2</sup> and a moment of inertia equal to
10,000.0 in<sup>4</sup> in order to give them high axial and
flexural stiffness, respectively. The elements are defined in <a
href="elemPanelZone2D.tcl" title="wikilink">elemPanelZone2D.tcl</a>. The
spring has a trilinear backbone which is created with the <a
href="Hysteretic_Material" title="wikilink">Hysteretic material</a> in
<a href="rotPanelZone2D.tcl" title="wikilink">rotPanelZone2D.tcl</a>.
This procedure also constrains the translational degrees of freedom at
the corners of the panel zone. The spring’s backbone curve is derived
using the principle of virtual work applied to a deformed configuration
of the panel zone (Gupta and Krawinkler 1999).</p>
<h3 id="reduced_beam_sections_rbs">Reduced Beam Sections (RBS)</h3>
<p>Using an RBS which is offset from the beam-column joint ensures that
the beam’s plastic hinge forms away from the column and thus protects
the column’s integrity. In this model, the decrease in moment of inertia
at the RBS is neglected; however, the yield moment at the RBS is
calculated based on the reduced section properties. The plastic hinge is
modeled by a rotational spring placed at the center of the RBS. An <a
href="elastic_Beam_Column_Element" title="wikilink">elastic beam-column
element</a> is used to connect the spring and the panel zone. Since this
element is not part of the spring-elastic element-beam subassembly
described in the “Stiffness Modifications to Elastic Frame Elements”
section of the <a href="Pushover_Analysis_of_2-Story_Moment_Frame"
title="wikilink">Pushover Analysis of 2-Story Moment Frame</a> example,
its moment of inertia and stiffness proportional damping coefficient are
not modified by an “n” factor.</p>
<h3 id="application_points_for_masses_and_loading">Application Points
for Masses and Loading</h3>
<p>Since loads cannot be applied at the center of the beam-column joint,
gravity loads are applied at the top node of the panel zone where it
meets the column (node xy7 in Figure 2). Both masses and lateral loads
are applied at the centerline of the floor level along the right side of
the panel zone (node xy05 in Figure 2).</p>

<h3 id="pushover">Pushover</h3>
<p>The pushover analysis is identical to the analysis performed in the

where the structure is pushed to 10% roof drift, or 32.4”.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic">Dynamic</h3>
<p>The dynamic analysis is identical to the analysis performed in the <a

Dynamic Analysis of 2-Story Moment Frame</a> example where the structure
is subjected to the 1994 Northridge Canoga Park record.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The first and second mode periods of the structure obtained from an
eigenvalue analysis are T<sub>1</sub> = 0.81 s and
T<sub>2</sub> = 0.18 s, respectively. These values agree
with the SAP2000 model which had periods of T<sub>1</sub> =
0.81 s and T<sub>2</sub> = 0.20 s.</p>
<p>The periods of this OpenSees model are slightly smaller than the
periods of the structure used in <a
href="Pushover_Analysis_of_2-Story_Moment_Frame"
title="wikilink">Pushover Analysis of 2-Story Moment Frame</a> which had
periods of T<sub>1</sub> = 0.83 s and
T<sub>2</sub> = 0.22 s. This is expected because the
including the panel zone regions makes the structure stiffer.</p>
