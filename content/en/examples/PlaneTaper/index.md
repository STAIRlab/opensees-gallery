A finite element analysis is performed of a plane tapered cantilever using constant-strain triangles. 
The [ElasticIsotropic](https://opensees.stairlab.io/user/manual/material/ndMaterials/ElasticIsotropic.html) material model is employed.
Visualization is performed in the script [`render.py`](render.py) using the [`veux`](https://pypi.org/project/veux) library.
