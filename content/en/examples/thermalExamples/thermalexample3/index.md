A steel beam is subjected to a uniform temperature
using a linear time-temperature history. Vertical midspan displacement
of the heated beam is recorded throughout the analysis. An investigation
is performed on the impact the following parameters have on the midspan
displacement of the beam: (i) including 2nd order geometric
transformations, and (ii) restraining the horizontal displacement of the
boundary conditions

## Objectives

1.  Develop a simply supported steel beam model using displacement-based
    beam elements with tempurature-dependent material properites,
2.  Record the midspan vertical displacment due to a linear
    time-temperature heating curve and a uniformly distributed gravity
    load, and
3.  Demonstrate the difference in midspan displacement of the beam when
    including 2nd order geometric transformations and restraining the
    beam against horizontal displacement of the beam ends.

## Material

The uniaxialMaterial Steel01Thermal includes temperature-dependent steel
thermal and mechanical properties according to Eurocode 3 carbon steel.
More details of Steel01 can be found at: [Steel01
Material](https://opensees.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Steel01_Material)

```tcl
uniaxialMaterial Steel01Thermal $matTag $Fy $Es $b;
```

Es = 210000 MPa (Young's modulus of elasticity at ambient temperatures)

Fy = 250 MPa (Yield strength of material at ambient temperatures)

b = 0.01 (Strain-Hardening Ratio)

## Transformation

Both Linear & Corotational (Non-Linear)Transformations were used, and
the resulting midspan displacements of the beams were recorded to view
differences of including 2nd order bending effects.

## section

This example uses a W-shape beam, therefore an external .tcl script is
used to define the fiber sections. This script uses fibersecThermal to
procure a fibered W-shape section with a section tag to be used while
defining elements. Eight fibers are used throughout the web and four
fibers within each flange.

In previous versions of OpenSees, a default value for torsional
stiffness was used (GJ). In versions 3.1.0 and newer fiber sections
require a value for torsional stiffness. This is a 2D example with
negligible torsion, however a value is required. The Young\'s Modulus is
used for convenience.

Wsection dimensions:

> ```tcl
> set d 355; #mm

> ```tcl
> set bf 171.5; #mm

-   d = nominal depth
-   tw = web thickness
-   bf = flange width
-   tf = flange thickness
-   nfdw = number of fibers along web depth
-   nftw = number of fibers along web thickness
-   nfbf = number of fibers along flange width
-   nftf = number of fibers along flange thickness
-   Gj = torsional stiffness

## Element

`dispBeamColumnThermal` elements are used because temperature-dependent
thermal and mechanical steel properties can be applied to these
elements. Any portion of the structure that is being heated must use
elements that are compatible with uniaxialMaterial Steel01Thermal. At
the time this model was developed, `dispBeamColumnThermal` was the only
element type that could have tempurature-dependent thermal and
mechanical properties applied to them.

This example was developed using 6 elements along the length of the
beam.

```tcl
# dispBeamColumnThermal $eleTag $iNode $jNode $numIntgrPts $secTag $TransfTag;
element dispBeamColumnThermal $secTag 1 2 5 $secTag $transftag;
```

This example will build off of the benchmarked examples and therefore
used 5 iteration points in each element to simulate the beam bending and
thermal expansion.

## Output Recorders

`dataDir` is defined at the beginning of the model, this creates a
folder within your working directory where output files will be saved.

```tcl
set dataDir Examples/EXAMPLE3_OUTPUT;
```

```tcl
file mkdir $dataDir;
```

Displacement of the midspan node (4) in DOF 2 (Vertical Displacement)

```tcl
recorder Node -file $dataDir/Midspan_Disp.out\" -time -node 4 -dof 2
disp;
```

Reaction forces at end nodes (nodes 1 & 7)

```tcl
recorder Node -file $dataDir/RXNs.out -time -node 1 7 -dof 2 reaction;
```

## Thermal Loading

This particular model is heating a beam to a set temperature over the
time period of the model. We are not asking OpenSees to use a specific
time-temperature curve, rather linearly ramp up the temperature from
ambient to 1180 &deg; C.

Therefore, we set the maximum temperature as follows:

```tcl
set T 1180; # Max temperature, deg. celsius
```

In OpenSees, the user can define 2 or 9 temperature data points through
the cross section. In a 2D analysis framework, like this example,
temperature data point locations are specified on the y-axis of the
local coordinate system (as shown in the figure above). And are linearly
interpolated between the defined points. Because this example is using a
uniformly heated beam, two temperature points on each extreme fiber on
the y-axis will be chosen. The beam has a depth of `d`, therefore, Y1 =
`d`/2 & Y2 = -`d`/2 the top and bottom fibers respectively.

Top fiber of beam

```tcl
set Y1 [expr $d/2];
```

Bottom fiber of beam

```tcl
set Y2 [expr -$d/2];
```

![](img/Example3_fig2.png){.align-centeralign-center width="500px"}

**Location of defined input temperature locations on the member cross
section**

The bottom extreme fiber temperature must be defined first. The target
maximum temperature for each extreme fiber is set to 1180 &deg; C and will
be increased incrementally and linearly as the time step continues in
the analysis. An external temperature data set could also be used for
more complex temperature loading.

Using a plain linear loading pattern, Elements 1-6 will be heated to the
target tempurature, `T` using a for loop for effecency. The syntax for
this is:

```tcl
pattern Plain 3 Linear {for {set level 1} {$level \<= 6} {incr level 1}
{set eleID $level eleLoad -ele $eleID -type -beamThermal $T $Y2 $T
$Y1;}}
```

## Thermal Analysis

Thermal loading is applied in 1000 steps, with a load factor of 0.001.
Each step is a 0.001 increment of the maximum temperature specified in
the thermal loading step: `T`. The analysis is a static analysis and the
contraints of the beam are plain. 1000 increments was also used during
thermal analysis to allow for easy correlation between the input
temperatures and the recorded output.

A variety of load factors were examined and the solution converged when
a load factor of 0.001 was used. OpenSees is sensitive to the load
factor, therefore, it is important to ensure that benchmarking examples
are performed to determine the proper load factor to use in structural
fire engineering analyses.

```tcl
set Nstep 1000;
```

Thermal load is applied in `1000` steps. Each step is an 0.001 increment
of the maximum temperature specified in the thermal loading step `T`
(1180)

```tcl
set Factor [expr 1.0/$Nstep];

integrator LoadControl $Factor;

analyze $Nstep;
```

## Output Plots

After the model has completed running, the results will be a vertical
midspan displacement of the recorded node. Since the temperature was
linearly ramped up from ambient to 1180 &deg; C, the user can develop a
temperature history that matches every increment of the model.
Additionally,mid-span displacement of the beam when including 2nd order
geometric transformations, as well as restraining the horizontal
boundary conditions are plotted. The same model was executed in the
finite element software Abaqus additonally plotted as \"AB\".
