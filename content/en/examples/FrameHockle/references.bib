  abstract = {A key aspect of robotics today is estimating the state, such as position and orientation, of a robot as it moves through the world. Most robots and autonomous vehicles depend on noisy data from sensors such as cameras or laser rangefinders to navigate in a three-dimensional world. This book presents common sensor models and practical advice on how to carry out state estimation for rotations and other state variables. It covers both classical state estimation methods such as the Kalman filter, as well as important modern topics such as batch estimation, the Bayes filter, sigmapoint and particle filters, robust estimation for outlier rejection, and continuous-time trajectory estimation and its connection to Gaussian-process regression. The methods are demonstrated in the context of important applications such as point-cloud alignment, pose-graph relaxation, bundle adjustment, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Students and practitioners of robotics alike will find this a valuable resource.},

  abstract = {The parameterization of rotation is the subject of continuous research and development in many theoretical and applied fields of mechanics, such as rigid body, structural, and multibody dynamics, robotics, spacecraft attitude dynamics, navigation, image processing, and so on. This paper introduces the vectorial parameterization of rotation, a class of parameterization techniques encompassing many formulations independently developed to date for the analysis of rotational motion. The exponential map of rotation, the Rodrigues, Cayley, Gibbs, Wiener, and Milenkovic parameterization all are special cases of the vectorial parameterization. This generalization parameterization sheds additional light on the fundamental properties of these techniques, pointing out the similarities in their formal structure and showing their inter-relationships. Although presented in a compact manner, all of the formul\ae{} needed for a complete implementation of the vectorial parameterization of rotation are included in this paper.},

This document discusses an alternative approach which makes use of a more abstract notion of 3D orientations. The relative orientation between two coordinate systems is primarily identified by the coordinate mapping it induces. This is combined with the standard exponential map in order to introduce representation-independent and minimal differentials, which are very convenient in optimization based methods.},

Rotation vector increments corresponding to different tangent spaces are generally related by a linear operator, known as the tangential transformation T. In this note, we derive the higher order terms that are usually left out in linear relation. The exact nonlinear relation is also presented. Errors via the linearized T are numerically estimated. While the concept of T arises out of the nonlinear characteristics of the rotation manifold, it has been derived via tensor analysis in the context of computational mechanics (Cardona and G\'eradin, 1988). We investigate the operator T from a Lie group perspective, which provides a better insight and a 1\textendash 1 correspondence between approaches based on tensor analysis and the standard matrix Lie group theory.},

  abstract = {Implicit Newmark schemes for integration of finite rotations in structural and continuum mechanics typically are more complicated than those used for translational motion. Using Euler's representation of the rotation tensor in terms of a rotation vector {$\varphi$}, numerical integration connecting the values \{{$\varphi$}n, n\} and \{{$\varphi$}n+1, n+1\} at the beginning and end of the time step is expressed in terms of an incremental rotation vector \texttheta{} and the associated incremental rotation tensor (\texttheta ). Here, it is shown using backward differentiation that neglecting third order terms in \texttheta, the approximation for the angular velocity {$\omega$} in terms of \texttheta{} and its time derivative has the same form as that between velocity and displacement. Consequently, the simplified Newmark scheme in terms of \{\texttheta, {$\omega$}, {$\omega$}\textperiodcentered{} \} has the same form as that for updating translations. Details of the Newmark scheme and an analytical expression for the tangent stiffness tensor for the associated Newton\textendash Raphson iteration procedure have been presented for rigid body dynamics. The resulting integration scheme has been tested on a nontrivial problem of three-dimensional motion of a rigid body using a constant time step. The results justify the use of the simplified Newmark scheme for finite rotations.},

  abstract = {Non-linear models of beams, shells and polar continua are addressed from a general point of view with the aim of providing a clear motivation of the fact that the tangent stiffness of these structural models may be nonsymmetric. Classical and polar models of continua are investigated and a critical analysis of the commonly adopted strain measures is performed. It is emphasized that the kinematic space of a polar continuum is a non-linear differentiable manifold. Accordingly, by choosing a connection on the manifold, the Hessian operator of the elastic potential is defined as the second covariant derivative of the elastic potential. The Hessian operator can be expressed as the difference between the second directional derivative along the trial and test fields and the first directional derivative in the direction of the covariant derivative of the test field along the trial field. It follows that the evaluation of the Hessian operator requires the extension of the local virtual displacement to a vector field over the non-linear kinematic manifold. In any case the tensoriality of the Hessian operator ensures that the result is independent of the choice of the extension, and its symmetry depends on whether or not the assumed connection is torsionless. Conservative and nonconservative loads are considered and it is shown that, at equilibrium points, the tangent stiffness is independent of the chosen connection on the fiber manifold and symmetry holds for conservative loads.},

Nonetheless, the element offers significant advantages over existing stiffness-based approaches, since no discretization error occurs and all governing equations are satisfied exactly. Consequently, fewer elements are needed to yield results of comparable accuracy. This is demonstrated with the analysis of several simple example structures by comparing the results from flexibility and stiffness-based elements.},

  abstract = {Beam elements are commonly used in the analysis of steel and reinforced concrete structures in earthquake engineering practice. These elements reproduce the global behavior of these structures at a reasonable computational cost. For this type of analysis the force-based fiber beam element has proven an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational cost for the simulation of the inelastic response of structural models of significant size. Recent studies have proposed extensions of the model to account for the effect of shear and torsion under fixed shear strain or stress distributions. These assumptions suffer from shortcomings for the representation of the coupling between shear and torsion, and are not suitable for the representation of local stress and strain distributions at critical sections. To describe such complex stress states, shell finite element models are often used with a significant increase in computational cost. This paper presents the mixed formulation of an enhanced 3d fiber beam element that represents accurately the global and local response of structural members under axial force, flexure, shear and torsion interaction. The proposed 3d fiber beam element determines the shear strain distribution at a section from the satisfaction of local equilibrium equations with the section warping displacements as local parameters. Unlike existing models, the coupling between sections is taken in account. Hence the enhanced fiber beam-column is able to capture the local effects due to constrained warping of the section, such as the flange shear lag effect. The model is also capable of representing accurately the maximum local stress at element boundaries, and of simulating the torsional response of beams under warping constraints.},

Separate objects encapsulate material stress-strain behavior and cross-sectional integration in order to increase the modeling flexibility for computing the response of fiber-discretized cross sections. Multiple forms of distributed plasticity in beam-column elements are incorporated in the framework through objects that encapsulate one-dimensional quadrature rules. Software design patterns are utilized to create complex beam-column simulation models by composition of basic building blocks.

  abstract = {The objective of this work is to develop finite elements for the simulation of thin Kirchhoff rods, that is, rods where the influence of transverse shear strain can be neglected leading to governing equations that require C1-continuous finite element interpolations. We start in this paper with the formulation of new finite elements for the infinitesimal plane deformations of otherwise generally curved rods, addressing in particular the lack of invariance observed in related traditional treatments of plane arches. By noninvariance we mean that the classical rigid-body modes of translations and infinitesimal rotations of the underlying structural theory lead to non-zero strains in the element, an effect sometimes referred to as self-straining. This phenomenon occurs in curved configurations of the elements and, in the infinitesimal setting of interest in this paper, it results in the elements stiffness matrix not to exhibit the correct zero-energy modes associated with these physical rigid-body motions. As a consequence, the basic equilibrium relations of balance of forces and moments are not satisfied for the associated nodal forces and moments in non-invariant finite elements. In this context, we propose a new framework for the formulation of C1-continuous finite elements based on Hermitian shape functions that do lead to the satisfaction of this fundamental invariance property, accounting fully for the rod's curvature and associated Kirchhoff's kinematics in contrast to common straight (framework) element approximations based on the simplified Euler\textendash Bernoulli beam kinematics. The formulation relies crucially on a consistent treatment of the kinematics and the assumed interpolation of the rods geometry. An additional assumed strain treatment is considered to avoid limitations of membrane locking. Complete rigorous analyses and several numerical simulations are presented to prove and illustrate the properties and performance of the newly proposed finite element methods.},

The element is derived from a two-field mixed formulation with independent approximation of internal forces and transverse displacements. The nonlinear response of the steel and concrete component of the girder is based on the section discretization into fibers with uniaxial hysteretic material models for the constituent materials. The partial interaction between concrete deck and steel girder through shear connectors is accounted for by an interface model with distributed force transfer characteristics. A direct state determination algorithm for the implementation of the composite element in a general purpose nonlinear analysis program is presented, and the stability characteristics of the algorithm are discussed in conjunction with the selection of appropriate force and displacement interpolation functions. The validity of the model is established by correlation of analytical results with experimental evidence. Numerical studies are used to compare the model with the classical displacement formulation. These studies confirm the superiority of the proposed model in modeling composite girders under monotonic and cyclic loads that induce stiffness deterioration and strength softening.},

The model is based on a two-field mixed formulation, where forces and deformations are both approximated within the element. The nonlinear response of the concrete and tendon components is based on the section discretization into fibers with uniaxial hysteretic material models. The stress transfer mechanism is modeled with a distributed interface element with special bond stress-slip relation. A method for accurately simulating the prestressing operation is presented. Accordingly, a complete nonlinear analysis is performed at the different stages of prestressing. Correlation studies of the proposed model with experimental results of pretensioned specimens are conducted. These studies confirmed the accuracy and efficiency of the model.},

Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 144 (1997) 163], the term co-rotational relates here to the provision of a local reference frame that continuously rotates and translates with the element. Within this context, several issues are emphasised. The first one refers to the parameterisation of finite 3D rotations. The alternative put forth in the paper is based on the spatial form of the incremental rotational vector. The second issue concerns warping effects which are introduced by adding a seventh degree of freedom at each node. Different types of local formulations are considered and it is shown that at least some degree of non-linearity must be introduced in the local strain definition in order to obtain correct results for certain classes of problems. Within the present approach the centroid and shear center of the cross-section are not necessarily coincident. Finally, in the context of instability problems, a method for the direct computation of critical points is also briefly discussed. This is based on a minimal augmentation procedure as developed by Eriksson [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 156 (1998) 45; Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 179 (1999) 265; Int. J. Struct.

This paper introduces the vectorial parameterization of rotation, a class of parameterization techniques encompassing many formulations independently developed to date for the analysis of rotational motion. The exponential map of rotation, the Rodrigues, Cayley, Gibbs, Wiener, and Milenkovic parameterization all are special cases of the vectorial parameterization. This generalization parameterization sheds additional light on the fundamental properties of these techniques, pointing out the similarities in their formal structure and showing their inter-relationships.

A new approach in describing the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of reinforced concrete elements is proposed. This approach consists of isolating the basic mechanisms that control the hysteretic behavior of RC members into individual subelements that are connected in series to form the RC member element. A shear subelement is presented in detail in this paper. It describes the shear sliding in the critical regions and the shear distortion along the member. In cases where a substantial axial force is present, the proposed shear subelement is capable of describing the interaction of axial force with the opening and closing of shear cracks. To establish the validity of the proposed model, correlation studies of analytical results with experimental evidence of the load-displacement response of shear critical RC members and subassemblies under static load reversals are conducted. The analytical results generally show very good agreement with experimental results.},

A previously proposed FE formulation is extended to allow the description of structural members with softening material behavior. The governing equations are derived from an extended four-field Hu-Washizu variational principle, with independent interpolation of the warping displacement field from the rigid section displacement, the generalized section deformation, and the material stress fields. A fiber discretization is used for the numerical integration of the nonlinear material response of the composite cross sections with a new plastic-damage model for the material description of the concrete fibers. The element state determination is based on a numerically efficient predictor-corrector scheme for the evolution of the internal variables of damage plasticity. The paper concludes with correlation studies of RC structural members under monotonic and cyclic loading and discusses the effect of cross-section warping on the damage evolution.

  abstract = {This article considers a generalization of the classical structural flexibility matrix. It expands on previous papers by taking a deeper look at computational considerations at the substructure level. Direct or indirect computation of flexibilities as ``influence coefficients'' has traditionally required pre-removal of rigid body modes by imposing appropriate support conditions, mimicking experimental arrangements. With the method presented here the flexibility of an individual element or substructure is directly obtained as a particular generalized inverse of the free\textendash free stiffness matrix. This generalized inverse preserves the stiffness spectrum. The definition is element independent and only involves access to the stiffness generated by a standard finite element program and the separate construction of an orthonormal rigid-body mode basis. The free\textendash free flexibility has proven useful in special application areas of finite element structural analysis, notably massively parallel processing, model reduction and damage localization. It can be computed by solving sets of linear equations and does not require processing an eigenproblem or performing a singular value decomposition. If substructures contain thousands of d.o.f., exploitation of the stiffness sparseness is important. For that case this paper presents a computation procedure based on an exact penalty method, and a projected rankregularized inverse stiffness with diagonal entries inserted by the sparse factorization process. These entries can be physically interpreted as penalty springs. This procedure takes advantage of the stiffness sparseness while forming the full free\textendash free flexibility, or a boundary subset, and is backed by an in-depth null space analysis for robustness. \'O 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

The key assumptions behind CR are: (i) strains from a corotated configuration are small while (ii) the magnitude of rotations from a base configuration is not restricted. Following a historical outline the basic steps of the Element Independent CR formulation are presented. The element internal force and consistent tangent stiffness matrix are derived by taking variations of the internal energy with respect to nodal freedoms. It is shown that this framework permits the derivation of a set of CR variants through selective simplifications. This set includes some previously used by other investigators. The different variants are compared with respect to a set of desirable qualities, including self-equilibrium in the deformed configuration, tangent stiffness consistency, invariance, symmetrizability, and element independence. We discuss the main benefits of the CR formulation as well as its modeling limitations.},

  abstract = {Several methods to derive accurate Timoshenko beam finite elements are presented and compared. Two application problems are examined: linear elastostatics and linearized prebuckling (LPB) stability analysis. Accurate elements can be derived for both problems using a well known technique that long preceeds the Finite Element Method: using homogeneous solutions of the governing equations as shape functions. An interesting question is: can accurate elements be derived with simpler assumptions? In particular, can linear-linear interpolation of displacements and rotations with one-point integration reproduce those elements? The answers are: no if standard variational tools based on classical functionals are used, but yes if modified functionals are introduced. The connection of modified functionals to newer methods, in particular templates, modified differential equations and Finite Increment Calculus (FIC) are examined. The results brings closure to a 50-year conumdrum centered on this particular finite element model. In addition, the discovery of modified functionals provides motivation for extending these methods to full geometrically nonlinear analysis while still using inexpensive numerical integration.},

  abstract = {In this paper a finite element formulation of eccentric space curved beams with arbitrary cross-sections is derived. Based on a Timoshenko beam kinematic, the strain measures are derived by exploitation of the Green-Lagrangean strain tensor. Thus, the formulation is conformed with existing nonlinear shell theories. Finite rotations are described by orthogonal transformations of the basis systems from the initial to the current configuration. Since for arbitrary cross-sections the centroid and shear center do not coincide, torsion bending coupling occurs in the linear as well as in the finite deformation case. The linearization of the boundary value formulation leads to a symmetric bilinear form for conservative loads. The resulting finite element model is characterized by 6 degrees of freedom at the nodes and therefore is fully compatible with existing shell elements. Since the reference curve lies arbitrarily to the line of centroids, the element can be used to model eccentric stiffener of shells with arbitrary cross-sections. 0 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

However, it also makes the choice of non-locking finite element interpolations somewhat more delicate. A hierarchical displacement interpolation proposed here is proved to be capable of eliminating both shear and membrane locking phenomena. A very satisfying non-locking performance is demonstrated for a set of problems in nonlinear elasto-statics.},

It has recently become apparent that the important requirement of objectivity of adopted strain measures, although provided by the theory itself, does not automatically extend to a finite element formulation. In this paper we present a new finite element formulation of the geometrically exact 3D beam theory, specifically designed to preserve the objectivity of the adopted strain measures. In order to do so the current local rotations are interpolated in a manner similar to that adopted in co-rotational approaclies. However, no approximations typical for co-rotational approaches are introduced into the procedure, so in contrast to co-rotational formulations, the present formulation fully preserves the geometric exactness of the theory. A range of numerical examples serves to illustrate the problem and to assess the formulation. \textcopyright{} 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Beam elements are commonly used in the analysis of steel and reinforced concrete structures in earthquake engineering practice. These elements reproduce the global behavior of these structures at a reasonable computational cost. For this type of analysis the force-based fiber beam element has proven an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational cost for the simulation of the inelastic response of structural models of significant size. Recent studies have proposed extensions of the model to account for the effect of shear and torsion under fixed shear strain or stress distributions. These assumptions suffer from shortcomings for the representation of the coupling between shear and torsion, and are not suitable for the representation of local stress and strain distributions at critical sections. To describe such complex stress states, shell finite element models are often used with a significant increase in computational cost. This paper presents the mixed formulation of an enhanced 3d fiber beam element that represents accurately the global and local response of structural members under axial force, flexure, shear and torsion interaction. The proposed 3d fiber beam element determines the shear strain distribution at a section from the satisfaction of local equilibrium equations with the section warping displacements as local parameters. Unlike existing models, the coupling between sections is taken in account. Hence the enhanced fiber beam-column is able to capture the local effects due to constrained warping of the section, such as the flange shear lag effect. The model is also capable of representing accurately the maximum local stress at element boundaries, and of simulating the torsional response of beams under warping constraints.},

The element is more accurate than current distributed inelasticity models in simulating the monotonic and cyclic inelastic response of beams and columns under typical curvature distributions, while being much more cost effective.

  abstract = {Mixed formulations of frame elements offer significant advantages over more traditional displacement formulations, particularly under large cyclic inelastic deformations including the effects of shear. This paper complements the recent proposal of a consistent variational basis for the mixed formulation of frame elements by supplying the explicit definition of the stress field over the cross-section. The paper also addresses the numerical stability of the element state determination algorithm in the presence of an ill-conditioned or even singular section stiffness matrix. The proposed algorithm is based on the eigendecomposition of the section stiffness matrix and uses the Sherman\textendash Morrison\textendash Woodbury formula and the Moore\textendash Penrose pseudoinverse to avoid the inversion of ill-conditioned matrices in the element state determination. In the extreme case of uniform tension or uniform flexure the section flexibility matrix is split into an elastic and a plastic component before eigendecomposition. With the proposed method the inelastic response of the element under multiple perfectly plastic hinges can be successfully traced. Numerical examples demonstrate the capabilities of the approach.

  abstract = {This report traces the history of the elastica from its first precise formulation by James Bernoulli in 1691 through the present. The complete solution is most commonly attributed to Euler in 1744 because of his compelling mathematical treatment and illustrations, but in fact James Bernoulli had arrived at the correct equation a half-century earlier. The elastica can be understood from a number of different aspects, including as a mechanical equilibrium, a problem of the calculus of variations, and the solution to elliptic integrals. In addition, it has a number of analogies with physical systems, including a sheet holding a volume of water, the surface of a capillary, and the motion of a simple pendulum. It is also the mathematical model of the mechanical spline, used for shipbuilding and similar applications, and directly insipired the modern theory of mathematical splines. More recently, the major focus has been on efficient numerical techniques for computing the elastica and fitting it to spline problems. All in all, it is a beautiful family of curves based on beautiful mathematics and a rich and fascinating history.},

  author = {Lew, Jennifer},
  doi = {10.1137/20S1357342},
  abstract = {The analytical solution for the large deformation of a cantilever beam under a point load, typically applied to the tip of the cantilever and perpendicularly to its axis, has been widely studied and published. However, the more complex case of two angled point loads applied to the cantilever has not been published. The current research delved into the following scenario: an upright cantilever, e.g. a pole, has point loads applied at two locations on the cantilever, where each point load is angled, i.e. the point load has both a horizontal component (which may result from wind loading) and downward vertical component of force (such as from weights). The aim of the research is to develop a methodology for finding, at the two locations where the point loads are applied, the angle of deflection, the horizontal deflection, and the vertically deflected height. Ultimately, the research yielded a methodology based on the Complete and Incomplete Elliptic Integrals of the First Kind and Second Kind. The analytical solution developed in this research - specifically the method for calculating the angles of deflections was compared against Finite Element Analysis and was found to produce nearly identical results. We conclude that the methodology shown can be extended to any number of point loads and will be a contribution to the field of non-linear mechanics.},

We divide vector spaces into material and spatial spaces since these spaces behave differently in the observer transformation and with objective derivatives (Liederivatives). All the vector spaces, which we consider, have a metric tensor thus they are metric vector spaces, and all the finite dimensional manifolds are Riemannian manifolds that are embedded in an Euclidean space. Additionally, we may identify a dual vector space by its primary vector space. In classical tensor analysis, this identification is applied, but here we make distinction between primary and dual spaces in the formulation, and the identification can be accomplished later. If the identification of dual and primary vector spaces is done a priori, then push-forward and pull-back operations are not uniquely defined. As an example, we will study the rotation manifold and its underlying geometric structure in the terms of differential geometry.},

Geometrically exact three-dimensional beam theory has no restrictions with respect to the magnitude of displacements, rotations and deformations. While reduced integration may be used to alleviate transverse shear and membrane locking in linear and quadratic C0-continuous Lagrange elements, this does not automatically extend to higher order elements. In this study we demonstrate that uniform reduced numerical quadrature rules may be used to obtain locking-free isoparametric large deformation geometrically exact curved beam elements of arbitrary order. A set of carefully selected numerical examples serves to illustrate and assess the performance of the various geometrically exact elements and compare them with one of the most popular finite element formulations for solving nonlinear beam problems based on the corotational formulation.},

  abstract = {The present work focuses on geometrically exact finite elements for highly slender beams. It aims at the proposal of novel formulations of Kirchhoff-Love type, a detailed review of existing formulations of Kirchhoff-Love and SimoReissner type as well as a careful evaluation and comparison of the proposed and existing formulations. Two different rotation interpolation schemes with strong or weak Kirchhoff constraint enforcement, respectively, as well as two different choices of nodal triad parametrizations in terms of rotation or tangent vectors are proposed. The combination of these schemes leads to four novel finite element variants, all of them based on a C1-continuous Hermite interpolation of the beam centerline. Essential requirements such as representability of general 3D, large-deformation, dynamic problems involving slender beams with arbitrary initial curvatures and anisotropic cross-section shapes, preservation of objectivity and path-independence, consistent convergence orders, avoidance of locking effects as well as conservation of energy and momentum by the employed spatial discretization schemes, but also a range of practically relevant secondary aspects will be investigated analytically and verified numerically for the different formulations. It will be shown that the geometrically exact Kirchhoff-Love beam elements proposed in this work are the first ones of this type that fulfill all these essential requirements. On the contrary, Simo-Reissner type formulations fulfilling these requirements can be found in the literature very well. However, it will be argued that the shear-free Kirchhoff-Love formulations can provide considerable numerical advantages such as lower spatial discretization error level, improved performance of time integration schemes as well as linear and nonlinear solvers or smooth geometry representation as compared to shear-deformable Simo-Reissner formulations when applied to highly slender beams. Concretely, several representative numerical test cases confirm that the proposed Kirchhoff-Love formulations exhibit a lower discretization error level as well as a considerably improved nonlinear solver performance in the range of high beam slenderness ratios as compared to two representative Simo-Reissner element formulations from the literature.},

The control sections of the frame element are subdivided into regions with 1D, 2D and 3D material response. The constitutive material model for reinforced and prestressed concrete follows the basic assumptions of the Modified Compression Field Theory with a tangent-stiffness formulation. The validity of the model is established by comparing its results with several well-known tests from the literature. These simulations include a variety of load combinations under bending, shear and torsion. The analytical results show excellent agreement with experimental data regarding the ultimate strength of the specimen and the local strain response from initiation of cracking to ultimate load.},

  abstract = {In recent years nonlinear dynamic analysis of three-dimensional structural models is used more and more in the assessment of existing structures in zones of high seismic risk and in the development of appropriate retrofit strategies. In this framework beam finite-element models of various degrees of sophistication are used in the description of the hysteretic behavior of structural components under a predominantly uniaxial state of strain and stress. These models are commonly derived with the displacement method of analysis, but recent studies have highlighted the benefits of frame models that are based on force interpolation functions (flexibility approach). These benefits derive from the fact that models with force interpolation functions that reproduce the variation of internal element forces in a strict sense yield the exact solution of the governing equations in the absence of geometric nonlinearity. While the numerical implementation of force-based models at first appears cumbersome, simple examples of nonlinear analysis in this paper offer conclusive proof of the numerical and computational superiority of these models on account of the smaller number of model degrees of freedom for the same degree of accuracy in the global and local response. A numerical implementation that bypasses the iterative nature of the element state determination in recent force-based elements is also introduced, thus further expanding the benefits of flexibility-based nonlinear frame models.},

Nonetheless, the element offers significant advantages over existing stiffness-based approaches, since no discretization error occurs and all governing equations are satisfied exactly.

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the SO(3) logarithmic map from various points of view. First, we propose two numerically stable solutions to the degenerate case of the logarithmic map (from SO(3) rotation matrices to so(3)-Lie algebra vectors) when the angle of rotation is close to or exactly pi. Second, we observe and theoretically prove that the Jacobian of the logarithmic map in a manifold sense (as the linear map between tangent spaces) can be found as a chain of Jacobians in a numerical sense of the logarithmic map and box plus operator via extending logarithmic map over the SO(3) manifold. Moreover, we show that the result of the chain rule does not depend on the extension of the log map, even though the numerical Jacobians of different extensions are different. These results ensure that we do not run into degenerate cases in practical implementations of optimization algorithms, such as with the Ceres solver library, for applications like pose graph optimization. We have proposed corresponding improvements to the implementation of SO3 in the popular Sophus library.},

  abstract = {In the context of the direct or Cosserat theory of rods developed by Green, Naghdi and several of their co-workers, this paper is concerned with the development of a theory of small deformations which are superposed on large deformations. ,The resulting theory is properly invariant under all superposed rigid body motions. Furthermore, it is also valid for elastic rods which are subject to kinematical constraints, and it specializes to a linear theory of an elastic rod which is invariant under superposed rigid body motions. The construction of these theories is based on the method developed by Casey \& Naghdi [1] who established similar theories for unconstrained nonpolar elastic bodies.},

The strong gradient of displacement near plastic regions in a fiber beam element can be accurately described using a special plastic enrichment function. The two types of the plastic enrichment functions are suggested for the cases where the plastic region is located fully inside an element and spread over a node, respectively. In this approach, the optimal shape of the plastic enrichment function can be updated by reflecting plastic deformation at the previous loading step. Furthermore, if plastic regions appear in multiple locations in an element, the corresponding plastic enrichment function can be adaptively reconstructed on the basis of plastic region distribution without introducing additional degrees of freedom. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated in terms of accuracy and computational cost through several numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {Structural members yielding in shear are used in earthquake resistant systems, such as eccentrically braced steel frames and systems with passive energy dissipation devices, in a conscious effort to concentrate the energy dissipation capacity of the structure in components that can be repaired or replaced after a major earthquake. The simulation of the energy dissipation capacity of these components is important in the evaluation of the seismic response of these structural systems. This paper presents a new beam element for the simulation of the hysteretic behavior of shear-yielding members. The element is based on a three-field variational formulation with independent force, displacement and deformation fields. The displacement field is based on Timoshenko's shear beam theory. The nonlinear response of the element arises from the integration of biaxial stress-strain relations over several control sections along the element length. The biaxial material model accounts for the interaction between normal and shear stress. While previous concentrated plasticity models involve parameter tuning for different loading and support conditions, the proposed model is general in its derivation of the axial force-shear-flexure interaction from the material response. The proposed model shows the characteristic advantages of force-based beam elements and is capable of simulating the inelastic response of short beams with a single element without suffering from shear locking. The effect of shear is significant in these members during the elastic and inelastic response. The ability of the model to accurately represent the hysteretic behavior of short shear-yielding members is ascertained with correlation studies of analytical results with available experimental data from shear-link experiments.},

This paper presents the model of a frame element for the hysteretic behavior of these members. The model is based on a three-field variational formulation with independent displacement, stress, and strain fields. The displacement field is based on the Timoshenko beam theory. The nonlinear response of the element is derived from the section integration of the multiaxial material stress-strain relation at several control points along the element, thus accounting for the interaction between normal and shear stress and the spread of inelastic deformations in the member. With the derivation of the axial force-shear-flexure interaction of short members from the material response the proposed model is general, in contrast to existing concentrated plasticity models that require parameter calibration for different loading and support conditions. Furthermore, the model does not suffer from shear locking and does not require mesh refinement for the accurate representation of inelastic member deformations. Correlation studies of analytical results with available experimental data of the hysteretic behavior of shear-yielding members confirm the capabilities of the proposed model. Its computational efficiency makes it suitable for large scale simulations of the earthquake response of structures with shear-yielding members.},

The integration of the evolution equations results in a nonlinear problem, which is linearized and solved with the Newton\textendash Raphson method using a sub-stepping strategy. The consistent tangent matrix can be formulated either in terms of the stress components in a general reference system or in terms of the principal stress and strain components with the former then transformed to the general reference system. In order to account for plane stress conditions, the stress\textendash strain relations of the 3d material model are then condensed out. Plane stress conditions are imposed by the linearization of the stresses that need to be set equal to zero; thus the strain fields are updated in the corresponding directions. This solution method is extended to include transverse pressure and the effect of transverse reinforcing steel for a 3d concrete material model. The equilibrium of the stresses in the reinforcing steel and concrete is linearized and the strain fields are updated until the residual satisfies a specified tolerance. The consistent tangent matrix due to the condensation process is derived. The proposed algorithms are tested at the material and element level by comparison of numerical solutions with available experimental data.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a spatial Timoshenko beam element with a total Lagrangian formulation. The element is based on curvature interpolation that is independent of the rigid-body motion of the beam element and simpli\"yes the formulation. The section response is derived from plane section kinematics. A two-node beam element with constant curvature is relatively simple to formulate and exhibits excellent numerical convergence. The formulation is extended to N -node elements with polynomial curvature interpolation. Models with moderate discretization yield results of su cient accuracy with a small number of iterations at each load step. Generalized second-order stress resultants are identi\"yed and the section response takes into account non-linear material behaviour. Green\textendash Lagrange strains are expressed in terms of section curvature and shear distortion, whose \"yrst and second variations are functions of node displacements and rotations. A symmetric tangent sti ness matrix is derived by consistent linearization and an iterative acceleration method is used to improve numerical convergence for hyperelastic materials. The comparison of analytical results with numerical simulations in the literature demonstrates the consistency, accuracy and superior numerical performance of the proposed element.

Initially, a step-by-step development of the theoretical solution is provided and is compared with numerical analysis based on beam and shell elements. It is shown that the large deflections predicted by numerical analysis using beam elements accurately capture the theoretical results as compared to shell elements. Comparison of above deflections with theoretical and numerical approaches based on small deflection theory is also provided to show the extent of latter's applicability. Finally, it is shown that for a linear elastic working range of common engineering metals, both small and large deflection approaches yield same results and one can adopt the simple small deflection approach for engineering design. It is highlighted that the theoretical approach of large deflection commonly available in design texts is valid only within the linear elastic strain limit and recommends a careful approach to designers. Further, the effect of parametric variation in geometry and stiffness of beam on large deflection, and resulting bending strains and tip reactions are analyzed and discussed.},

Two vector equilibrium equations, valid on the rod axis are derived exactly, by direct integration of the mechanical balance laws of continuum mechanics over the rod cross section. Then the energetically conjugate exact 6-\textregistered eld kinematics of the rod axis is implied in an integral identity, which expresses the principle of the virtual work. The kinematics consists of the displacement vector of the axis, describing the average translation, and the proper orthogonal tensor, representing the average rotation of the cross section. The integral identity also suggests the required general form of the constitutive relations. They are already approximate from the physical side, are then the best place to make geometric approximations and abbreviations to a certain constrained theory. The constitutive relations, the only nonexact segment of the theory, are treated here as an interchangeable element, supplementing the exactly formulated principle of virtual work.},

  abstract = {Conventional co-rotational formulations for geometrically nonlinear analysis are based on the assumption that the finite element is only subjected to nodal loads and as a result, they are not accurate for the elements under distributed member loads. The magnitude and direction of member loads are treated as constant in the global coordinate system, but they are essentially varying in the local coordinate system for the element undergoing a large rigid body rotation, leading to the change of nodal moments at element ends. Thus, there is a need to improve the co-rotational formulations to allow for the effect. This paper proposes a new consistent corotational formulation for both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko two-dimensional beam-column elements subjected to distributed member loads. It is found that the equivalent nodal moments are affected by the element geometric change and consequently contribute to a part of geometric stiffness matrix. From this study, the results of both eigenvalue buckling and second-order direct analyses will be significantly improved. Several examples are used to verify the proposed formulation with comparison of the traditional method, which demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method in buckling analysis of frame structures under distributed member loads using a single element per member.},

  abstract = {A new 3-node co-rotational element formulation for 3D beam is presented. The present formulation differs from existing co-rotational formulations as follows: 1) vectorial rotational variables are used to replace traditional angular rotational variables, thus all nodal variables are additive in incremental solution procedure; 2) the Hellinger-Reissner functional is introduced to eliminate membrane and shear locking phenomena, with assumed membrane strains and shear strains employed to replace part of conforming strains; 3) all nodal variables are commutative in differentiating Hellinger-Reissner functional with respect to these variables, resulting in a symmetric element tangent stiffness matrix; 4) the total values of nodal variables are used to update the element tangent stiffness matrix, making it advantageous in solving dynamic problems. Several examples of elastic beams with large displacements and large rotations are analysed to verify the computational efficiency and reliability of the present beam element formulation.},

The point is subtle and was not made in ref. 2, although the applications given there are correct. As an example, the geometrical stiffness of a straight beam in space with all degrees of freedom is established. There follows the extension of the geometrical stiffness concept to a sub-element. This is of great practical significance for two reasons. First, it allows to derive the geometrical stiffness of elements of complex shape and behaviour, e.g. curved beams in space subjected to normal forces, bending moments and torque.},

This paper introduces the vectorial parameterization of rotation, a class of parameterization techniques encompassing many formulations independently developed to date for the analysis of rotational motion. The exponential map of rotation, the Rodrigues, Cayley, Gibbs, Wiener, and Milenkovic parameterization all are special cases of the vectorial parameterization. This generalization parameterization sheds additional light on the fundamental properties of these techniques, pointing out the similarities in their formal structure and showing their inter-relationships.

Vectors in a Euclidean space can be comaterial in only two different senses, related to the behavior of their contravariant and covariant convected components; second-order tensors, regarded as linear transformations on a Euclidean vector space, can be comaterial in four different senses, related to their contravariant, covariant, and mixed representations; and, so on for tensors of higher order. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for comateriality. These lead immediately to other conditions that can be stated in terms of ``comaterial rates'', which are Lie derivatives. Extensions and generalizations of the Helmholtz-Zorawski criterion are presented. The results are kinematical in nature and hold for all materials.},

In general it is very demanding to obtain rotations from known rotational strains. In the paper we limit our studies to the constant strain field along the element. The relation between the total three-dimensional rotations and the rotational strains is complicated even when a constant strain field is assumed. The analytical solution for the rotation matrix is for constant rotational strains expressed by the matrix exponential. Despite the analytical relationship between rotations and rotational strains, the governing equations of the beam are in general too demanding to be solved analytically. A finite-element strain-based formulation is presented in which numerical integration in governing equations and their variations is completely omitted and replaced by analytical integrals. Some interesting connections between quantities and non-linear expressions of the beam are revealed. These relations can also serve as useful guidelines in the development of new finite elements, especially in the choice of suitable shape functions.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper investigates the application of the co-rotational method to solve geometrically nonlinear topology optimization problems. The main benefit of this approach is that the tangent stiffness matrix is naturally positive definite, which avoids some numerical issues encountered when using other approaches. Three different methods for constructing the tangent stiffness matrix are investigated: a simplified method, where the linear elastic stiffness matrix is simply rotated; the consistent method, where the tangent stiffness is derived by differentiating residual forces by displacements; and a symmetrized method, where the consistent tangent stiffness is approximated by a symmetric matrix. The co-rotational method is implemented for 2D plane quadrilateral elements and 3-node shell elements. Matlab code is given in the appendix to modify an existing, freely available, density-based topology optimization code so it can solve 2D problems with geometric nonlinear analysis using the co-rotational method. The approach is used to solve four benchmark problems from the literature, including optimizing for stiffness, compliant mechanism design, and a plate problem. The solutions are comparable with those obtained with other methods, demonstrating the potential of the co-rotational method as an alternative approach for geometrically nonlinear topology optimization. However, there are differences between the methods in terms of implementation effort, computational cost, final design, and objective value. In summary, schemes involving the symmetrized tangent stiffness did not outperform the other schemes. For problems where the optimal design has relatively small displacements, then the simplified method is suitable. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the consistent method, as it is the most accurate.},

We introduce the following three nonlinear spatial beams: The Timoshenko beam, the Euler\textendash Bernoulli beam and the inextensible Euler\textendash Bernoulli beam. In the spatial theory, the Euler\textendash Bernoulli beam and its inextensible companion are presented as constrained theories. In the planar case, both constrained theories are additionally described using an alternative kinematics that intrinsically satisfies the defining constraints of these theories.},

Using a Petrov\textendash Galerkin projection method, we propose a whole family of rod finite element formulations where the nodal generalized virtual displacements and generalized velocities are interpolated instead of using the consistent variations and time derivatives of the ansatz functions. This approach leads to a significant simplification of the expressions in the discrete virtual work functionals. In addition, independent strategies can be chosen for interpolating the nodal centerline points and cross-section orientations. We discuss three objective interpolation strategies and give an in-depth analysis concerning locking and convergence behavior for the whole family of rod finite element formulations.},

  abstract = {We explore an isoparametric interpolation of total quaternion for geometrically consistent, strain-objective and path-independent finite element solutions of the geometrically exact beam. This interpolation is a variant of the broader class known as slerp. The equivalence between the proposed interpolation and that of relative rotation is shown without any recourse to local bijection between quaternions and rotations. We show that, for a two-noded beam element, the use of relative rotation is not mandatory for attaining consistency cum objectivity and an appropriate interpolation of total rotation variables is sufficient. The interpolation of total quaternion, which is computationally more efficient than the one based on local rotations, converts nodal rotation vectors to quaternions and interpolates them in a manner consistent with the character of the rotation manifold. This interpolation, unlike the additive interpolation of total rotation, corresponds to a geodesic on the rotation manifold. For beam elements with more than two nodes, however, a consistent extension of the proposed quaternion interpolation is difficult. Alternatively, a quaternion-based procedure involving interpolation of relative rotations is proposed for such higher order elements. We also briefly discuss a strategy for the removal of possible singularity in the interpolation of quaternions, proposed in [I. Romero, The interpolation of rotations and its application to finite element models of geometrically exact rods, Comput. Mech. 34 (2004) 121\textendash 133]. The strainobjectivity and path-independence of solutions are justified theoretically and then demonstrated through numerical experiments. This study, being focused only on the interpolation of rotations, uses a standard finite element discretization, as adopted by Simo and Vu-Quoc [J. C. Simo, L. Vu-Quoc, A three-dimensional finite rod model part II: computational aspects, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 58 (1986) 79\textendash 116]. The rotation update is achieved via quaternion multiplication followed by the extraction of the rotation vector. Nodal rotations are stored in terms of rotation vectors and no secondary storages are required.},

Furthermore, the Euler\textendash Bernoulli beam is formulated with a minimal set of kinematical descriptors together with a constrained version that satisfies inextensibility. Whenever possible, the numerical results of the different formulations are compared with analytical and semi-analytical solutions.

  abstract = {We present a novel consistent singularity-free strain-based finite element formulation for the analysis of three-dimensional frame-like structures. Our model is based on a geometrically exact finite-strain beam theory, quaternion parametrization of spatial rotations, assumption that the strain measures are constant along the length of the element and a proper choice of basis for the translational strain vector representation. As it is common for strain-based elements, the present formulation does not suffer from shear locking. A comparison of our results with the results from the literature and a commercial finite element analysis software demonstrates the advantages of the proposed formulation, especially when the structure is subjected to larger shear deformations. This stems from the fact that our model ensures a mathematically consistent updating procedure for all the quantities describing the beam. This aspect is often overlooked, since most of the numerical cases from other studies on this topic engage rather small-shear strains for which the consistent update is not crucial as the number of elements is increased.},

The proposed formulation accounts for large deformations in three-dimensional problem settings consisting of slender, prismatic beams with arbitrarily curved initial geometries and arbitrary cross-section shapes. Like in geometrically exact Reissner theories the derived deformation measures are geometrically exact in the sense that they are consistent with the strong and weak form of the balance equations and the beam geometry for any configuration and for arbitrarily large translations, rotations and strains. A novel orthogonal interpolation strategy is applied to the triad field representing the cross-section orientation in order to fulfill the Kirchhoff constraint of vanishing shear strains in a strong sense and to preserve the objectivity of the spatially discretized problem. The continuity requirements resulting from the corresponding weak form are fulfilled by a cubic Hermite interpolation, thus leading to a C1-continuous representation of the beam centerline. Fundamental properties such as objectivity, path-independence, consistency and accuracy of the developed beam element are verified by means of suitable numerical examples.},

The weak form is constructed with a non-orthogonal projection corresponding to the application of the virtual power theorem. Together with an appropriate time-collocation, it ensures exact conservation of momentum and total energy in the absence of external forces. Appealing is the fact that nonlinear hyperelastic materials (and not only materials with quadratic potentials) are permitted without any prejudice on the conservation properties.

Several moment and finite rotation definitions that have been used in the past are investigated and, in particular, it is shown that the various existing definitions for the so-called semi-tangential moments are distinct in the finite rotation range and that not all of them are conservative. The tangent operator symmetry is discussed in the context of finite element analysis of conservative systems with rotational degrees of freedom, adopting either an additive or a multiplicative update.},

Their mathematical and computational treatment is delicate because they do not possess the structure of a vector space but, instead, that of a Lie group. For this reason, many of the operations that are often carried out in a straightforward manner in linear spaces have to be re-examined. In this chapter, we describe the fundamental aspects that need to be dealt with when employing rotations in numerical methods, namely their parameterization, update, interpolation, and linearization of functions on rotations. Additionally, two key applications are presented: the integration of the rigid body equations, and the approximation of the equations of geometrically exact rods.},

The invariance property of the equilibrium equations under rigid body motions is discussed and brought out in simple analytical examples. The discretization method based on the exponential map is recalled and a geometric interpretation is given. Special attention is also dedicated to the consistent interpolation of the velocities.},

  abstract = {We introduce a three-dimensional geometrically nonlinear Reissner beam theory with embedded strong discontinuities for the modeling of failure in structures and discuss its finite element implementation. Existing embedded beam theories are geometrically linear or two-dimensional, motivating the need for the present work. We propose a geometrically nonlinear beam theory that accounts for cracks through displacement discontinuities in 3D. To represent the three modes of fracture inside an element, we enrich each displacement field with an incompatible mode parameter in the form of a jump, an additional degree of freedom. We then eliminate these nodeless degrees of freedom through static condensation and evaluate them within the framework of inelasticity by utilizing an operator split solution procedure. Seeing that the coupled strain-softening problem is non-convex, we present an alternating minimization (staggered) algorithm, thus retaining a positive definite stiffness matrix. Finally, the four-parameter representation by quaternions describes a three-dimensional finite rotation. We demonstrate a very satisfying and robust performance of these new finite elements in several numerical examples, including the fracture of random lattice structures with application to fibrous materials. We show that accounting for geometrical nonlinearity in the beam formulation is necessary for direct numerical simulations of fiber networks regardless of the density.},

Reissner-Simo's theory is able to model the mechanical behaviour of slender structural members involving arbitrarily large displacements and rotations. Rod centreline displacements and cross sectional rotations are used as model variables; the exact mathematical treatment of rotations is achieved by handling them as elements of the special orthogonal group. The choice of suitable parametrizations of the rotations, and the difficulties and specificities of finite element implementations of this theory are reviewed. Numerical examples using the author's implementation are presented, and finally the potential for future applications for form finding of bending active structures is pointed out.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns a novel isogeometric Timoshenko beam formulation for a geometrically nonlinear analysis of spatial beams using the total Lagrangian description. Constitutive laws for hyperelastic materials, whose behavior varies with their deformations, are widely defined by using strain energy density functions that are written in terms of the Green\textendash Lagrange strain tensor. Many finite element beam formulations for geometrically nonlinear analyses of spatial beams are developed using the Green\textendash Lagrange strain tensor and its energy conjugate, the second Piola\textendash Kirchhoff stress tensor. Unfortunately, there virtually exist no isogeometric Timoshenko beam formulations for this type of analysis that are derived by using this energy conjugate pair. To allow the possibility of considering hyperelastic materials, the present isogeometric beam formulation is developed in the total Lagrangian description using the Green\textendash Lagrange strain tensor and the second Piola\textendash Kirchhoff stress tensor. The proposed formulation is capable of simulating beam structures that are subjected to large displacements and rotations, without any restriction in magnitude. Three-dimensional beam configurations are reduced into one-dimensional structures using the beam axis and director vectors of the cross sections. The cross-sectional rotation along the beam axis is represented by an orthogonal tensor, which is parameterized by a vector-like parameter. Updating the cross-sectional rotations is performed purely by natural exponentiation and superposition of relevant rotational quantities. To show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed beam formulation, some benchmark and well-established numerical examples with various types of beam, i.e., straight, curved, pre-twisted beams, are analyzed. The obtained results are compared with those results in the literature, obtained from both analytical and numerical methods.},

The mutual relationships between the variations of rotation vector and its complement and the spin variable are presented. It shows that the switch of rotation parameter between rotation vector and its complement preserves not only the strains but also the angular velocity and acceleration, and the force vectors and tangent matrices of an element. Two singularity-free corotational shell element formulations are presented. The first formulation is a non-consistent one, in which a simple way only using rotation vector is proposed to modify the exact rotation update approach via the Baker\textendash Campbell\textendash Hausdorff formula, while the second formulation is a consistent one. The novelty is that, following the presented method, the existing singular spatial beam and shell element formulations based on rotation vector parameterization could be modified to be the singularity-free ones with only a few changes. Finally, three numerical examples involving large rotations are analyzed to demonstrate the capability of the presented formulations.},

The present formulation, based on the Timoshenko beam hypothesis, is capable of effectively solving geometrically nonlinear problems such as large deformation, postbuckling, lateral buckling, and snap-through problems. The kinematics have been constructed with the concept of co-rotational formulation adopted in the finite element method (FEM). A meshfree method based on the differential reproducing kernel (DRK) approximation collocation method, combined with the Newton\textendash Raphson method, is employed to solve the strong forms of the geometrically nonlinear problems. The DRK method takes full advantage of the meshfree method. Moreover, only a scattered set of nodal points is necessary for the discretization. No elements or mesh connectivity data are required. Therefore, DRK will be able to completely circumvent the problems of mesh dependence and mesh distortion. The effectiveness of this study and its performance are shown through several numerical applications.},

  abstract = {We review the application of torsion in field theory. First we show how the notion of torsion emerges in differential geometry. In the context of a Cartan circuit, torsion is related to translations similar as curvature to rotations. Cartan's investigations started by analyzing Einsteins general relativity theory and by taking recourse to the theory of Cosserat continua. In these continua, the points of which carry independent translational and rotational degrees of freedom, there occur, besides ordinary (force) stresses, additionally spin moment stresses. In a 3-dimensional continuized crystal with dislocation lines, a linear connection can be introduced that takes the crystal lattice structure as a basis for parallelism. Such a continuum has similar properties as a Cosserat continuum, and the dislocation density is equal to the torsion of this connection. Subsequently, these ideas are applied to 4-dimensional spacetime. A translational gauge theory of gravity is displayed (in a Weitzenboeck or teleparallel spacetime) as well as the viable Einstein-Cartan theory (in a Riemann-Cartan spacetime). In both theories, the notion of torsion is contained in an essential way. Cartan's spiral staircase is described as a 3-dimensional Euclidean model for a space with torsion, and eventually some controversial points are discussed regarding the meaning of torsion.},

  abstract = {The Cosserat brothers published in 1909 an original book where they favour a variational formulation of continuum mechanics together with an invariance which they call ``Euclidean invariance'' of the Lagrangian-Hamiltonian action. This strategy places on an equal footing translations and possible rotational degrees of freedom, yielding in a natural way what is now commonly called the theory of Cosserat or oriented\textemdash or polar\textemdash continua with asymmetric stresses and the new notion of couple stresses. Here their landmark work is replaced in its epoch making context underlining the influences they benefited from and the influence they have exerted on their direct contemporaries and much later on (in the second-half of the twentieth century). The sociological scientific environment of the early twentieth century and the typical publication strategy of the time are outlined, explaining thus the Cosserats' own strategy. The further reception of their work from 1909 to the Second World War and the revival of interest in it in the nineteen-fifties are examined critically. Finally, the formalization of their work in a new landscape of continuum thermo-mechanics created essentially by Truesdell is evoked together with other influences and further developments.},

To judge from his publications in 1922\textendash 24, Cartan developed his concept of generalized spaces with the dual context of general relativity and non-standard elasticity in mind. In this context it seemed natural to express the translational curvature of his new spaces by a rotational quantity (via a kind of Grassmann dualization).

It is shown that, in general, this analysis requires the computation of s quadratic forms in m variables, which can be easily computed from the states of self-stress and mechanisms of the assembly. If any linear combination of these quadratic forms is sign definite, then the mechanisms are first-order infinitesimal. An efficient and general algorithm to investigate these quadratic forms is given. The calculations required are illustrated for some simple examples.},

The physical significance of the four linear-algebraic vector subspaces of the equilibrium matrix is examined, and an algorithm is set up which determines the rank of the matrix and the bases for the four subspaces. In particular, this algorithm gives full details of any states of self-stress and modes of inextensional deformation which an assembly may possess. A scheme is devised for the segregation of inextensional modes into rigid-body modes (up to six of these may be allowed by the foundation constraints) and "internal" mechanisms. In some circumstances a state of self-stress may impart first-order stiffness to an inextensional mode. A matrix method for detecting this effect is devised, and it is shown that if there is no state of self-stress which imparts first-order stiffness to a given mode, then that mode can undergo rather large distortion which involves either zero change in length of the bars or, possibly, changes in length of third or higher order in the displacements. The significance of negative stiffness, as indicated by the matrix method, is discussed. The paper contains simple examples which illustrate all of the main points of the work.},

A matrix algorithm which treats these two modes separately is developed and tested. It is shown that the equilibrium requirements for the assembly, in its initial configuration as well as in deformed configurations which are obtained through infinitesimal inextensional displacements, can be fully described by a square equilibrium matrix. It is also shown that any set of extensional nodal displacements has to satisfy some equilibrium conditions as well as standard compatibility equations, and that the resulting system of linear equations defines a square kinematic matrix. Theoretical as well as experimental evidence supporting this approach is given in the paper; two simple experiments which were of crucial importance in arriving at the equilibrium conditions on the extensional displacements are described.},

The element is based on curvature interpolation that is independent of the rigid-body motion of the beam element and simpli{\"y}es the formulation. The section response is derived from plane section kinematics. A two-node beam element with constant curvature is relatively simple to formulate and exhibits excellent numerical convergence. The formulation is extended to N -node elements with polynomial curvature interpolation. Models with moderate discretization yield results of su cient accuracy with a small number of iterations at each load step. Generalized second-order stress resultants are identi{\"y}ed and the section response takes into account non-linear material behaviour. Green{\textendash}Lagrange strains are expressed in terms of section curvature and shear distortion, whose {\"y}rst and second variations are functions of node displacements and rotations. A symmetric tangent sti ness matrix is derived by consistent linearization and an iterative acceleration method is used to improve numerical convergence for hyperelastic materials. The comparison of analytical results with numerical simulations in the literature demonstrates the consistency, accuracy and superior numerical performance of the proposed element.

In particular, we employ interpolations of relative rotations and a new rotation vector update for a strain-objective finite element formulation in the material framework. We show that the update provides either the desired rotation vector or its complement. This rules out an additive interpolation of total rotation vectors at the nodes. Hence, interpolations of relative rotation vectors are used. Through numerical examples, we show that combining the proposed update with interpolations of relative rotations yields frame-invariant and path-independent numerical solutions. Advantages of the present approach vis-a-vis the updated Lagrangian formulation are also analyzed.},

  abstract = {We show that, for rigid body dynamics, the mid-point rule formulated in body co-ordinates exactly conserves energy and the norm of the angular momentum for incremental force-free motions, but fails to conserve the direction of the angular momentum vector. Further, we show that the mid-point rule formulated in the spatial representation is, in general, physically and geometrically meaningless. An alternative algorithm is developed which exactly preserves energy, and the total spatial angular momentum in incremental force-free motions. The implicit version of this algorithm is unconditionally stable and second order accurate. The explicit version conserves exactly angular momentum in incremental force-free motions. Numerical simulations are presented which illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed procedure, even for incremental rotations over 65 degrees. The procedure is directly applicable to transient dynamic calculations of geometrically exact rods and shells.},
