element which considers in-plane and out-of-plane interaction and for
removal of the element during nonlinear time history simulation in
OpenSees. In addition, the infill wall model and element removal
algorithm are briefly described. Interested readers can refer to the

<h2 id="modeling_of_the_infill_wall">Modeling of the Infill Wall</h2>

The described infill wall model is a model which considers the
interaction of in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) effects. Modeling of
the infill wall is performed by using the available OpenSees materials,
sections, elements and tcl commands. The infill wall model is comprised
of two equal size diagonal beamWithhinges elements and a midspan node
with OOP mass (Figure 1). The inelastic fiber section assigned to the
ends of the elements connected to the midspan node is discretized as
explained in the following paragraph. Elastic sections with very small
moment of inertia (to simulate moment release) are assigned to the ends
attached to the surrounding frame. The hinge length near the midspan
node is selected as short as possible in order to produce a relatively
sharp yield point for the element, while at the same time providing a
numerically stable solution. 1/10 of the total length of the diagonal is
a suitable value for the total hinge length (sum of the lengths of the
hinges on both sides of the node). The hinge length on the other end can
be selected as small as possible without losing numerical stability.

of Inelastic Fiber Section and Calculation of OOP mass</h3>

The inelastic fiber section of the beamWithhinges element is modeled
by strategically locating a collection of nonlinear fiber elements[1,2].
The fibers are located along a line in the OOP direction (Z-direction in
Figure 1). By this way, the beam-column element acts as a truss element
and a flexural element in the IP and OOP directions, respectively. The
discretization of the cross section is shown in Figure 2a. In this
figure, the vector used to define the local-coordinate system in
OpenSees, `vecxz`, is `(0 0 -1)` corresponding to the global axes shown in
Figure 1. Each fiber is defined with the area
 \(\mathrm{A_i}\) , \(z\)-coordinate
\(\mathrm{z_i}\) and a bilinear stress-strain
relationship. The strain hardening slope is chosen to be very small,
hence the yield stress \(\mathrm{f_{yi}}\) and
the yield strain \(\mathrm{{\epsilon}_{yi}}\)
define the stress-strain relationship of the
\(\mathrm{i_{th}}\) fiber. Since only one
diagonal is utilized in the model, it has both tension and compression
strengths. Therefore, the fibers are considered to have the same
absolute value for the tensile and compression yield strengths.

</figure>

The parameters defining a fiber section
(\(\mathrm{A_i}\),
\(\mathrm{z_i}\),
 $\mathrm{f_{yi}}$ , and
 $\mathrm{{\epsilon}_{yi}}$ ) are set such that
the intended strength interaction (Figure 2b) and the IP axial and OOP
bending stiffness values of the diagonal infill wall element are
properly simulated. In the current formulation, FEMA-356[3] or
ASCE-41[4] equations are used for calculating the axial stiffness and
unidirectional strength in the IP direction. However, any other
relationships that the user considers as suitable can also be employed.
The OOP mass, stiffness and unidirectional bending strength are
calculated such that the model has the same natural frequency as the
original infill wall, it should produce the same support reactions where
it is attached to the surrounding frame for a given support motion
(story acceleration), and it should exhibit initial yielding at the same
level of support motion that causes the original infill wall to yield.
Discretization of the inelastic fiber section is explained below. In the
explanation, equations of FEMA-356 are referred to rather than ASCE-41
equations, since FEMA-356 document is accessible from FEMA website.
However, Equations of FEMA-356 and ASCE-41 are very similar and ASCE-41
equations may be replaced with FEMA-356 equations.

1. Calculate the IP axial force capacity of the equivalent diagonal
element ($\mathrm{P_{IP0}}$, Equation 1.
\[
P_{I P O}=\frac{Q_{C E}}{\cos \theta} \quad Q_{C E}=A_{\text {ni }} f_{\text {vie }}
\]

In Equation 1, $\mathrm{\Theta}$ is the
angle of the equivalent diagonal element with the horizontal.
$\mathrm{Q_{CE}}$ is the expected infill shear
strength, $\mathrm{A_{ni}}$ is the area of net
mortared/grouted section across infill panel and
$\mathrm{f_{ive}}$ is the expected shear
strength of masonry infill. Second part of Equation 1 corresponds to
Equation 7-15 in FEMA-356.

2. Calculate the OOP moment capacity under zero IP axial force
   (MOOP0) for the equivalent diagonal element, Equation 2.
   \[
   \begin{aligned} 
   & \mathrm{M}_{\text {OOp0 }}=1.570 \frac{\mathrm{L}_{\text {diag }}}{\mathrm{h}_{\text {inf }}} \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{y}} \\ & \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{y}}=\frac{\mathrm{q}_{\mathrm{in}} \mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{inf}} \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{inf}}{ }^2}{8} \\ & \mathrm{q}_{\mathrm{in}}=\frac{0.7 \mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{m}} \lambda_2}{\left(\mathrm{~h}_{\mathrm{inf}} / \mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{inf}}\right)}
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   In Equation 2, $\mathrm{L_{diag}}$ is the
   length of the equivalent diagonal element and
   $\mathrm{h_{inf}}$,
   $\mathrm{L_{inf}}$ and
   $\mathrm{t_{inf}}$ are the height, length and
   thickness of the infill wall panel, respectively.
   $\mathrm{q_{in}}$ is the OOP strength of the
   infill wall panel, $\mathrm{f_{m}}$ is the
   expected value of masonry compressive strength and
   $\mathrm{{\lambda}_2}$ is a slenderness
   parameter defined in Table 7-11 of FEMA-356. Equation 2c corresponds to
   Equation 7-21 in FEMA-356.

   Equation 2 is based on the assumption that the yield moment in the
   equivalent diagonal element is reached when the support spectral
   acceleration equals the yield spectral acceleration of the original
   infill wall. Derivation of Equation 2 can be found in Appendix D of
   reference [1].

3. Construct the IP axial and OOP bending strength interaction curve
   accepted as a 3/2-power curve[1, 2] represented with Equation 3. The 3/2
   power curve is based on the OOP and IP capacity points obtained from the
   analyses of a nonlinear finite element (FE) model of an infill panel[3].
   In Equation 3, $\mathrm{P_{IP}}$ is the IP
   axial strength in the presence of OOP force,
   $\mathrm{P_{IP0}}$ , which is calculated in step 1, is the IP axial strength without OOP force,
   $\mathrm{M_{OOP}}$ is the OOP bending strength
   in the presence of IP force, and
    $\mathrm{M_{OOP0}}$ , which is calculated in
   step 2, is the OOP bending strength without IP force.
   <figure>
   <img src="Eq3.jpg" title="Eq3.jpg" alt="Eq3.jpg" />
   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Eq3.jpg</figcaption>
   </figure>
   It should be noted that steps 1, 2 and 3 consist of the construction
   of the IP axial and OOP bending strength interaction based on the
   explained methodology. The user is free to use any other interaction
   curve which might be based on experimental data or FE simulations, as
   long as the chosen interaction curve is not concave, since the equations
   used for calculation of the fiber locations are not suitable for concave
   diagrams. However, this limitation is not considered to be serious,
   since a concave interaction diagram is rarely encountered.

   The interaction diagram should be discretized at N pairs (N pairs
   including the (\(\mathrm{M_{OOP0}}\), 0) and (0,
    $\mathrm{P_{IP0}}$ ) pairs), where 2(N-1) is the
   total number of fibers in the section (N-1 fibers are placed at one side
   of the y-axis and N-1 fibers on the other side symmetrically as shown in
   Figure 2). Typically, 10 fibers along the section could be sufficient
   which corresponds to 6 data pairs on the interaction diagram.

4. Calculate the equivalent strut width “a” using Equation 4, which
corresponds to Equation 7-14 in FEMA-356. Then, cross-sectional area of
the diagonal element becomes tinf×a. The user is free to use any other
relationship to calculate the area of the equivalent diagonal element or
the equivalent width.
<figure>
<img src="Eq4.jpg" title="Eq4.jpg" alt="Eq4.jpg" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Eq4.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>

where $\mathrm{h_{col}}$ is the height of
the column of the surrounding frame,
$\mathrm{E_{m}}$ and
$\mathrm{E_{f}}$ are the elasticity moduli of
the infill and frame materials, respectively. Equation 4 is unit
dependent where force is in kips and displacement is in inches.

5. Calculate the equivalent moment of inertia of the diagonal element
   in the OOP direction, $\mathrm{I_{eq}}$.
   Considering that the model has the same natural frequency as the
   original infill wall and it should produce the same support reactions
   where it is attached to the frame for a given story acceleration,
   $\mathrm{I_{eq}}$ is calculated with Equation 5.
   <figure>
   <img src="Eq5.jpg" title="Eq5.jpg" alt="Eq5.jpg" />
   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Eq5.jpg</figcaption>
   </figure>
   where $\mathrm{\kappa}$ is a factor which
   represents the reduction in moment of inertia due to cracking.

6. Calculate the distance of the $\mathrm{i^{th}}$ fiber to the centroid
   ($\mathrm{z_{i}}$, Equation 6.
   <figure>
   <img src="Eq6.jpg" title="Eq6.jpg" alt="Eq6.jpg" />
   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Eq6.jpg</figcaption>
   </figure>
   where M and P represent the OOP bending moment and IP axial force
   capacities in the interaction diagram (Figure 3). i=1 corresponds to the
   fiber farthest from the centroid and the point of pure compression on
   the P−M diagram. The index i increases sequentially in the section as
   progressing inward to the y-axis and in the interaction diagram in the
   direction of decreasing P as shown in Figure 3. It should be noted that
   the coordinates of the points
   ($\mathrm{z_{i}}$ on one side of the y axis
   (positive z) are calculated with Equation 6 but coordinates of the
   points on the other side are calculated as the negative of the values
   calculated with Equation 6.
   Equation 6 is obtained from the consideration of the changes in the
   plastic axial force and moment that occur as the plastic neutral axis is
   “swept through” the section. Derivation of this equation is explained in
   reference [2].
   <figure>
   <img src="Figure3.jpg" title="Figure3.jpg" alt="Figure3.jpg" />
   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure3.jpg</figcaption>
   </figure>

7. Area of each fiber is calculated such that the sum of the areas of
  the fibers is equal to the cross sectional area of the equivalent
  diagonal element (\(\mathrm{t_{inf}}\) ×a)
  calculated in step 4 and sum of the second moment of the fibers is equal
  to the equivalent moment of inertia in OOP direction
  ($\mathrm{I_{eq}}$ calculated in step 5.
  <figure>
  <img src="Eq7a.jpg" title="Eq7a.jpg" alt="Eq7a.jpg" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Eq7a.jpg</figcaption>
  </figure>
  In order to have a unique solution of Equation 7a, the relationship
  between $\mathrm{A_{i}}$ and
  $\mathrm{z_{i}}$ is assumed to be represented
  with Equation 7b.
  <figure>
  <img src="Eq7b.jpg" title="Eq7b.jpg" alt="Eq7b.jpg" />
  <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Eq7b.jpg</figcaption>
  </figure>
  since $\mathrm{z_{i}}$ values are known from
  Equation 6, $\mathrm{\gamma}$ and
  $\mathrm{\eta}$ can be determined from Equation 7. Then, the area of each fiber is calculated using Equation 7b.

8. Calculate yield stress and yield strain for each fiber, Equations 8 and 9.
   <figure>
   <img src="Eq89-2.jpg" title="Eq89-2.jpg" alt="Eq89-2.jpg" />
   <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Eq89-2.jpg</figcaption>
   </figure>
   Equation 8b is obtained from the consideration of the change in the
   plastic axial force that occurs as the plastic neutral axis (PNA in
   Figure 2) is “swept through” the section. Derivation of this equation is
   explained in reference [2].


9. In addition to the fibers along z direction, a dummy fiber (a
fiber with a very small area) should be located at an arbitrary point
along the y-axis (Figure 2) to supply a very small IP moment of
inertia.

The inelastic fiber section is discretized following the above nine
steps. Cross sectional area obtained in step 4 and moment of inertia in
OOP direction obtained in step 5 are used as area and moment of inertia
about the local axis corresponding to the OOP direction for the interior
elastic part of the beamWithhinges element. A very small number is input
for the moment of inertia about the other sectional local axis.
<h3 id="calculation_of_oop_mass_at_the_midspan_node">Calculation of OOP
Mass at the Midspan Node</h3>

As stated previously, the described infill wall element is comprised
of two equal size diagonal beamWithhinges elements and a midspan node
with OOP mass. This mass at the midspan node is calculated as 0.81M,
where M is the total mass of the infill wall panel. This value is the
first mode effective mass of the infill wall panel when it is defined as
a beam spanning vertically with distributed mass and with simple
supports at the ends. Theoretical derivation can be found in reference
[1].
<h2
id="implementation_of_infill_wall_removal_in_opensees">Implementation of
Infill Wall Removal in OpenSees</h2>

A progressive collapse algorithm is developed [4-6], the different
applications of which can be found in references [7-10]. This algorithm
is developed using element removal based on dynamic equilibrium and
resulting transient change in system kinematics, the underlying theory
of which can be found in the above references. The progressive collapse
algorithm is implemented for automated removal of collapsed elements
during an ongoing simulation (Figure 4). The implementation is carried
out as a new OpenSees module, designed so that it is called by the main
analysis module after each converged load step to check each element for
possible violation of its respective removal criteria. A violation of
any pre-defined removal criterion triggers the activation of the element
removal algorithm on the violating element before returning to the main
analysis module. Activation of the element removal algorithm includes
updating nodal masses, checking if the removal of the collapsed element
results in leaving behind dangling nodes or floating elements, which
must be removed as well (Figure 5), and removing all associated element
and nodal forces, imposed displacements, and constraints.
<figure>

</figure>

Other than the aforementioned infill wall element, removal criteria
are defined for force- and displacement-based distributed plasticity
fiber elements and lumped plasticity beam-column elements with
fiber-discretized plastic hinges. These criteria are based on
material-level damage indices for a newly developed confined RC
cross-section model [11-13]. The removal of the latter elements are not
considered in the current version of OpenSees. However, they will be
available in near future. Current version considers only the removal of
the infill wall model described in the first section.

Implementation of the removal of the elements representing the
aforementioned infill wall analytical model in the progressive collapse
algorithm is performed through defining a removal criterion for the
beam-column elements of this model. This criterion is based on the
interaction between the IP and OOP displacements. IP displacement is the
relative horizontal displacement between the top and bottom nodes of the
diagonal element. OOP displacement is that of the middle node (where the
OOP mass is attached) with respect to the chord which connects the top
and bottom nodes. The user is free to choose any interaction
relationship between IP and OOP displacements. In the recent studies
conducted with the introduced infill wall element [14, 15], same
equation used for the strength interaction is considered for the
displacement interaction, where IP and OOP displacement capacities in
the presence of zero load in the other direction are obtained from
FEMA-356 for collapse prevention level. During the nonlinear time
history simulation, when the mentioned combination of displacements from
the analysis exceeds the interaction curve (Figure 6), the two
beam-column elements and the middle node, representing the unreinforced
masonry infill wall, are removed. The procedure for the removal of an
infill wall is presented in Figure 7.

</figure>
<h2 id="new_command_in_opensees_interpreter">New Command in OpenSees Interpreter</h2>

The only new tcl command in the OpenSees interpreter with respect to
the infill wall removal is the collapse recorder. Three collapse
recorders (the syntax of which are indicated below) are needed for the
consideration of the removal of an infill wall. These collapse recorders
should be defined individually for each infill wall that the user would
like to be considered for removal.

```tcl
recorder Collapse -ele $ele1 -time -crit INFILLWALL -file $filename \
       -file_infill $filenameinf -global_gravaxis $globgrav -checknodes $nodebot $nodemid $nodetop
recorder Collapse -ele $ele2 -time -crit INFILLWALL -file_infill \
       $filenameinf -global_gravaxis $globgrav -checknodes $nodebot $nodemid $nodetop
recorder Collapse -ele $ele1 $ele2 -node $nodemid
```

`$ele1`, `$ele2`, `$nodebot`, `$nodemid`, and `$nodetop` are shown in Figure 8.
Element objects store the identities of their associated Node objects in
the data structures of OpenSees. Therefore, it might seem that node
inputs are unnecessary. However, when there are shear springs in the
model, $nodetop and $nodebot should be the nodes of the springs which
connect to the beams, since the shear spring deformation contributes to
the IP displacement of the infill wall. These nodes are not the nodes of
the diagonal element. Therefore, it is necessary to input these nodes.
$filename is the file name for element removal log. Only one log file is
constructed for all collapse recorder commands (i.e. for all removals).
The first file name input to a collapse recorder command is used and any
subsequent file names are ignored. $filenameinf is the file used to
input the displacement interaction curve. Two columns of data are input
in this file where only positive values are input. First column is the
OOP displacement in ascending order and second column is the
corresponding IP displacement. Full interaction should be defined. In
other words, first value of OOP displacement and last value of IP
displacement should be zero. -crit INFILLWALL is used to state that the
removal is for the infill wall, because there will be options for
removal of other elements in the next versions of OpenSees as mentioned
previously. $globgrav is the global axis of the model in the direction
of gravity. 1, 2 and 3 should be input for X, Y and Z axes,
respectively. For example, it is equal to 2 in Figure 1.
