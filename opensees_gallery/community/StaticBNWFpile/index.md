This article describes the OpenSees implementation of a simple
laterally-loaded pile example. The problem is modeled as a beam on a
nonlinear Winkler foundation (BNWF), utilizing displacement-based beam
elements for the pile and nonlinear spring elements which represent the
vertical and lateral response of the surrounding soil. This example
considers a static analysis only.

analysis in OpenSees;

Download them all in a compressed file: 
<a href="./StaticBNWFanalysis.zip">staticBNWFanalysis.zip</a>

To run this example, the user must download each of the above files
and place them in a single directory. Once this has been done, the user
can then type `source staticBNWFpile.tcl` into the interpreter of the
OpenSees.exe application to run the analysis. Representative results are
presented in this article to verify the correct implementation of this
example. Additionally, the pile response obtained from this analysis is
compared to a similar analysis conducted using the commercial program
LPile (http://www.ensoftinc.com) to provide verification the results of
the OpenSees analysis.

The BNWF model simulates the laterally-loaded pile problem using
displacement-based beam elements to represent the pile and a series of
nonlinear springs to represent the soil. The soil springs are generated
using zero-length elements assigned separate uniaxial material objects
in the lateral and vertical directions. An idealized schematic of the
laterally-loaded pile model is provided in Fig. 1.


The pile axis is oriented in the z-coordinate direction, and all of
the nodes are initially located on the z-axis (x- and y- coordinates are
zero). Node numbering for each set of nodes begins at the bottom of the
pile. The model is created with three separate sets of nodes:

<ul>
<li>fixed spring nodes (numbers 1-85 in example)</li>
<li>slave spring nodes (numbers 101-185 in example)</li>
<li>pile nodes (numbers 201-285 in example)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="geometry_and_mesh">Geometry and Mesh</h3>

The geometry is rather simple in this example. There is only a single
layer of cohesionless soil, and the groundwater table is assumed to be
well below the tip of the pile. The pile geometry controls the meshing
of the problem. The user can specify the length of the pile head (above
the ground surface), L1, and the embedded pile length (below the ground
surface), L2. The default values in 
<a href="./StaticBNWFpile.tcl">staticBNWFpile.tcl</a> are L1 = 1 m, and L2 = 20 m. The
pile is also assigned a diameter of 1 m. This value is used in the soil
constitutive modeling.

The mesh is defined by the number of elements specified in the pile.
The default value in this example is 84 elements (85 nodes). For the
default pile geometry, this results in 80 elements over the embedded
length and 4 elements above the ground surface. <strong>Note:</strong>
The input file is only set up to handle up to 100 nodes. Modifications
would need to be made to the node numbering scheme to accommodate a
larger number of nodes.

<h3 id="spring_nodes">Spring Nodes</h3>
The spring nodes are created with three dimensions and three
translational degrees-of-freedom. The input file is set up to
automatically generate the necessary spring nodes and elements based
upon the input geometry (pile head length, `$L1`, embedded length, `$L2`,
and number of pile elements, `$nElePile`). Spring nodes are only created
over the embedded length of pile.


Since zero-length elements are used for the springs, the two sets of
nodes share the same set of locations. One set of spring nodes, the
fixed-nodes, are initially fixed in all three degrees-of-freedom. The
other set of nodes, the slave nodes, are initially fixed in only two
degrees-of-freedom, and are later given equal degrees-of-freedom with
the pile nodes.

<h3 id="spring_constitutive_behavior">Spring Constitutive Behavior</h3>

The constitutive behavior of the springs is defined such that the
springs oriented in the lateral direction represent p-y springs, and the
vertically-oriented springs represent t-z and Q-z springs for the pile
shaft and tip, respectively. Three procedures are used to properly
define the p-y/t-z/Q-z behavior with depth, <a
href="./get_pyParam.tcl" title="wikilink">get_pyParam.tcl</a>, <a
href="./get_tzParam.tcl" title="wikilink">get_tzParam.tcl</a>, and
<a href="./get_qzParam.tcl" title="wikilink">get_qzParam.tcl</a>

Several input soil properties are necessary to define these
springs:
<ul>
<li>soil unit weight, `$gamma`</li>
<li>soil internal friction angle, `$phi`</li>
<li>soil shear modulus, `$Gsoil`</li>
</ul>

The default values are set at `$gamma` = 17 kN/m^3, `$phi` = 36 degrees,
and `$Gsoil` = 150000 kPa.

The procedure <a href="./get_pyParam.tcl"
title="wikilink">get_pyParam.tcl</a>, which defines the p-y springs, has
several options which must be selected.
<ul>
<li>The first switch, `$puSwitch`, specifies the variation in ultimate
lateral resistance with depth. The default, `$puSwitch` = 1, uses the
recommendations of the American Petroleum Institute (API) (1993). The
alternative method is that of Brinch Hansen (1961).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The second switch, `$kSwitch`, specifies the variation in initial
stiffness with depth. The default, `$kSwitch` = 1, specifies a linear
variation of initial stiffness with depth (API 1993). The alternative
uses a modified version of the API stiffness which varies parabolically
with depth after Boulanger et al. (2003).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The presence of groundwater can be accounted for in the initial
stiffness using the third switch, `$gwtSwitch`. Default, `$gwtSwitch` = 1,
is for no groundwater.</li>
</ul>

The other procedures, <a href="./get_tzParam.tcl"
title="wikilink">get_tzParam.tcl</a> and <a href="./get_qzParam.tcl"
title="wikilink">get_qzParam.tcl</a>, have no input options in this
example. The t-z springs have behavior defined using the work of Mosher
(1984) and Kulhawy (1991). The Q-z behavior is based on the work of
Meyerhof (1976), Vijayvergiya (1977), and Kulhawy and Mayne (1990).

The p-y spring constitutive behavior is obtained using the <a
href="PySimple1_Material" title="wikilink">PySimple1</a> uniaxial
material object. The t-z and Q-z springs are defined using the <a
href="TzSimple1_Material" title="wikilink">TzSimple1</a> and <a
href="QzSimple1_Material" title="wikilink">QzSimple1</a> uniaxial
materials, respectively. The main input file is set up to automatically
generate the required spring material objects based upon the input
geometry and soil properties.
<h3 id="spring_elements">Spring Elements</h3>

Zero-length elements are used for the soil springs using the element
<a href="zeroLength_Element" title="wikilink">zeroLength</a>. These
elements connect the fixed and slave spring nodes. The the <a
href="PySimple1_Material" title="wikilink">PySimple1</a> material
objects are incorporated in the x-direction (direction of loading),
while the <a href="TzSimple1_Material" title="wikilink">TzSimple1</a>,
and at the pile tip, the <a href="QzSimple1_Material"
title="wikilink">QzSimple1</a>, material objects are incorporated in the
z-direction (vertical direction).
<h3 id="pile_nodes">Pile Nodes</h3>

The pile nodes are created with three dimensions and six
degrees-of-freedom (3 translational, 3 rotational). The input file is
set up to automatically generate the necessary pile nodes and elements
based upon the input geometry. A <a href="Linear_Transformation"
title="wikilink">linear coordinate-transformation</a> object is
specified for the orientation of the pile in this example. With the
exemption of the uppermost pile head node, the pile nodes are fixed
against translation in the y-direction and rotations about the x- and z-
axes. The pile head node, where the load is applied, is separated to
allow the user to specify a free-head (no rotational fixity) or
fixed-head (full rotational fixity) condition at the loading point.

The pile nodes over the embedded length of the pile are use linked
with the slave spring nodes using the <a href="equalDOF_command"
title="wikilink"> equalDOF</a> command. The pile nodes are the master
nodes in this example. These two sets of nodes share equal
degrees-of-freedom in the x- and z- translational directions only.
<h3 id="pile_constitutive_behavior_and_elements">Pile Constitutive
Behavior and Elements</h3>

In this example, the pile is given elastic behavior for simplicity.
Instead of using the <a href="Elastic_Beam_Column_Element"
title="wikilink">elasticBeamColumn</a> element, this is done using an <a
href="Elastic_Section" title="wikilink">elastic section</a> object in
conjunction with the displacement-based beam element, <a
href="Displacement-Based_Beam-Column_Element"
title="wikilink">dispBeamColumn</a>. This was done to facilitate future
incorporation of elastoplastic pile section behavior using <a
href="Fiber_Section" title="wikilink">fiber section</a> models by the
user.

The properties of the elastic section for this example are defined in
the file, <a href="./elasticPileSection.tcl"
title="wikilink">elasticPileSection.tcl</a>. The pile is defined with
appropriately computed values for the cross-sectional area and the
moments of inertia for its 1 m diameter, and is assigned a modulus of
elasticity, E = 25000000, and shear modulus, G = 9615385.
<h3 id="recorders">Recorders</h3>

Several recorders are defined for this model.
<ul>
<li>The displacements at the pile nodes in all three translational dof
are recorded for use in extracting the displaced shape of the pile.</li>
<li>The reaction forces in the p-y springs are recorded for use in
visualizing the lateral soil response.</li>
<li>The element forces in the pile elements are recorded in order to
obtain shear and moment diagrams for the pile.</li>
</ul>

The recorders are set up to only record values at 0.5 second
increments of pseudo-time during the analysis to facilitate the use of
smaller load steps. This is done with the variable `$timeStep`.

A display recorder is included in the input file to allow the user to
visualize the deformation of the pile in "real time" during the
analysis. The parameters are set up for the orientation of the pile in
this example.
<h3 id="loading">Loading</h3>

This example considers a 3500 kN load applied in the positive
x-direction at the head of the pile (uppermost pile node). This is
accomplished in the model using a <a href="Plain_Pattern"
title="wikilink">plain pattern</a> with optional time-series parameters.
The load increases linearly from 0 kN to 3500 kN over a 10 second
increment of pseudo-time (between 10 and 20 seconds) and is then held
constant after the loading period. Setting up the loading object in this
manner allows for more control over the analysis.
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

The analysis is conducted using the <a href="Load_Control"
title="wikilink">load-controlled integrator</a> with a loading step of
0.05. This value is selected based on the 10 second interval specified
in the loading object. 200 steps with a loading step of 0.05 will put
the last step exactly at 10 seconds of pseudo-time. 201 steps are used
in this example to make sure that the last recorded step is at the full
loading magnitude. The variables `$startT` and `$endT` are used to print the
cpu time needed to complete the analysis in the standard output or the
OpenSees interpreter. The remaining <a href="Analysis_Commands"
title="wikilink">analysis commands</a> are well-documented in the
OpenSees command manual.

A user can verify their downloaded files by running the main input
file, <a href="./StaticBNWFpile.tcl"
title="wikilink">StaticBNWFpile.tcl</a>, in OpenSees and comparing the
recorded results to some representative results included here. The
simplest verification is to use the spring reaction forces recorded in
the file reaction.out. A plot of the recorded spring reaction forces vs.
depth in the final recorded pseudo-time step (20.05) should create
something similar to that shown in Fig. 2. The response is negative from
the ground surface to about 7.5 m deep, then transitions to positive
until about 13 m deep, has a second smaller negative section, and then
is nearly zero near the tip of the pile.

This verification plot can be made fairly simply using spreadsheet
software. For those who prefer Matlab (http://www.mathworks.com/), the
following lines will extract the desired information when pasted into an
m-file.

```matlab
% create depth vector 
depth = linspace(-20,1,85);
% load data 
react = load('reaction.out');
% remove pseudo-time information 
react(:,1) = [];

% create plotting variable (divide by tributary area of pile to get force/length)
reactPlot = react(end,:)/0.25;
plot(reactPlot,depth)
```

The shear and moment diagram plots in the following section can also
be used for verification purposes.

analyses for fixed-head case.</figcaption>
</figure>

The commercial pile analysis program LPile (http://www.ensoftinc.com)
is used to verify the results obtained using the OpenSees
laterally-loaded pile model. The LPile analysis used the same geometric
and constitutive parameters defined in the OpenSees analysis, and two
cases were considered:
<ul>
<li>A free-head case where there is no rotational fixity about the
y-axis at the pile head</li>
<li>A fixed-head case where full rotational fixity is enforced at the
pile head.</li>
</ul>

The two analysis methods are compared via the recorded pile and soil
responses. Figs. 3 and 4 present these comparisons for the free-head and
fixed-head cases, respectively. Shown in these figures are the shear and
moment diagrams, displaced pile shapes, and the lateral soil response
recorded from each analysis. As shown, the LPile and OpenSees results
are fairly similar, especially for the free-head case.

The main reason for the differences shown in Figs. 3 and 4 is that
the p-y curves used in LPile are not the same as those used in the
OpenSees analysis. The LPile curves are defined using the method of
Reese et al. (1974), while the backbone of the p-y curves for the <a
href="PySimple1_Material" >PySimple1</a> uniaxial
material approximate the API (1993) recommendations. These two sets of
curves are similar, and in fact have identical initial and ultimate
responses, however, they vary in form over intermediate
displacements.


This is shown in Fig. 5, which plots the actual p-y response obtained
in the OpenSees simulation alongside the p-y curves used by LPile for
several depths. As shown, the hyperbolic tangent curves recommended by
the API do not match those used by LPile, especially for displacements
between approximately 0.001 and 0.037 m. The force returned by the <a
href="PySimple1_Material" title="wikilink">PySimple1</a> material object
for displacements in this range will therefore be greater than
corresponding forces used by LPile. This is confirmed by the soil
response comparison plots in Figs. 3 and 4. Where the pile displacements
are large, the LPile and OpenSees soil reactions are nearly identical,
but as the displacements become smaller with increasing depth, the
recorded soil reactions begin to differ. This difference in lateral soil
response is the main reason behind the small variability observed in the
recorded shear and moment diagrams and displaced shapes.

LPile and OpenSees analyses.</figcaption>
</figure>

Overall, the agreement between the OpenSees and LPile analyses
verifies that the BNWF model implemented in OpenSees is capable of
returning sensible results for laterally-loaded pile simulations. There
are differences between the results, however, these are relatively
minor. The OpenSees simulation predicts maximum pile shear, moment, and
deflection demands which are similar to those obtained from LPile, and
the discrepancies are attributable to known differences between the two
analysis methods.
