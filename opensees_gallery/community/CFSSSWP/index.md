# Cold-Formed Steel Steel Sheathed Shear Wall Panel examples

<p>In order to check the accuracy of the proposed models, results from
quasi-static non-linear analyses of Steel-Sheathed Cold-Formed Steel
Shear Wall Panel have been carried out using CFSSSWP uniaxialMaterial
model implemented into OpenSees version 2.4.6. For this purpose,
specimens 1C-b and 3C-a tested by Balh (2010) were selected from the
literature and analyzed under similar loading conditions. This set of
specimens covers a wide range of variation in physical and mechanical
characteristics such as: spacing, number, shear strength, diameter of
screw fasteners (sc, nc, Vs, and ds); wall aspect ratio (H/W); frame
thickness, chord stud moment of inertia, chord stud cross section area,
interior stud moment of inertia, yield and tensile strengths of steel
frame (tf, Af, Ife, Ifi, fyf, and fuf); sheathing thickness, yield and
tensile strengths of sheathing (type, ts, Fys, and Fus); as well as the
anchor bolt diameter of the HoldDown system (dt).</p>
<p>Each SWP was subjected to the Consortium of Universities for Research
in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE) loading protocol.</p>
