Corotational frame elements are used to approximate Euler's buckling load,
which is given by:
\[
P_{\mathrm{euler}} = \frac{\pi^2 EI}{L^2}
\]

This example is adapted from https://github.com/denavit/OpenSees-Examples .
The files for the problem are [`EulerBuckling.py`](EulerBuckling.py) for
Python, and [`EulerBuckling.tcl`](EulerBuckling.tcl) for Tcl.
