## Example 4.1

This example is of a reinforced concrete multibay two story frame, as
shown in Figure 1, subject to gravity loads.
The files for this example are:

A model of the frame shown in
Figure 1 is created. The number of objects in the model is
dependent on the parameter `numBay`. The `(numBay + 1)*3` nodes are
created, one column line at a time, with the node at the base of the
columns fixed in all directions. Three materials are constructed, one
for the concrete core, one for the concrete cover and one for the
reinforcement steel. Three fiber discretized sections are then built,
one for the exterior columns, one for the interior columns and one for
the girders. Each of the members in the frame is modelled using
nonlinear beam-column elements with 4 (`nP`) integration points and a
linear geometric transformation object.

For gravity loads, a single load pattern with a linear time series and
two vertical nodal loads acting at the first and second floor nodes of
each column line is used. The load at the lower level is twice that of
the upper level and the load on the interior columns is twice that of
the exterior columns.

For the lateral load analysis, a second load pattern with a linear time
series is introduced after the gravity load analysis. Associated with
this load pattern are two nodal loads acting on nodes 2 and 3, with the
load level at node 3 twice that acting at node 2.

The integrator for the analysis will be LoadControl with a load
step increment of `0.1`. 
The constraints are enforced with a `Plain` constraint handler. 

Once the components of the analysis have been
defined, the analysis object is then created. 
For this problem a Static
analysis is used and `10` steps are performed to load the model
with the desired gravity load.

After the gravity load analysis has been performed, the gravity loads
are set to constant and the time in the domain is reset to 0.0. A new
LoadControl integrator is now added. The new LoadControl integrator has
an initial load step of 1.0, but this can vary between `0.02` and `2.0`
depending on the number of iterations required to achieve convergence at
each load step. `100` steps are then performed.


The output consists of the file `Node41.out` containing a line for each
step of the lateral load analysis. Each line contains the load factor,
the lateral displacements at nodes 2 and 3. A plot of the
load-displacement curve for the frame is given in
Figure 2.
