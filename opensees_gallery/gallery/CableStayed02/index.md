The problem is implemented in the file [`CableStayedBridge.py`](CableStayedBridge.py),
and can also be run through the Tcl file [`CableStayedBridge.tcl`](CableStayedBridge.tcl).

This model is adapted from the [`opstool`](https://opstool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
project and has been adapted to use the robust `Model` class interface.
